# Data transfer indicator


OEMs can display a data transfer indicator on a device’s status bar for mobile operators that require it. When this feature is enabled, an arrow is displayed above the cellular data connection icon or Wi-Fi connection icon to indicate that data transfer is occurring.

The data transfer indicator, the cellular data connection icon, and the cellular signal strength icon are promoted on the status bar for 10 seconds and does not appear more frequently than once every 5 minutes. The data transfer indicator and the Wi-Fi connection icon are not promoted on the status bar.

However, users can tap the status bar to view the data transfer indicator above the bearer that’s transmitting data. The data transfer indicator, the cellular data connection icon, and the cellular signal strength icon are displayed for 10 seconds if cellular data transfer is occurring. The data transfer indicator and the Wi-Fi connection icon are displayed for 2 seconds if Wi-Fi data transfer is occurring.
