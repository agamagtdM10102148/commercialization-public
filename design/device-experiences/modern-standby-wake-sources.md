# Modern Standby wake sources


A PC that supports the Modern Standby power model must be capable of waking from standby in response to certain events, even if the platform has entered a very low-power idle state.

This topic describes the types of wake sources that must be able to wake the processor. It also explains which wake events should turn the screen on and which wake events should allow the screen to stay turned off. System integrators should use this information to ensure that their hardware platforms, firmware, and software can configure wake sources to achieve the required behavior.

## Overview of Modern Standby user experience for wake


The Modern Standby user experience is designed to model that of a cellular phone. When users finish using their phones, they press the system power button and the cell phone enters sleep mode. The phone remains asleep until the user presses the power button again, or a phone call, email, or instant message is received.

Similarly, when a PC is in Modern Standby, it looks and feels off—the screen is blanked, the system has no visible LED indicators, and there is no acoustic noise. However, a PC in Modern Standby remains on and connected to the Internet, just as the cell phone remains connected to the cellular network. (The Modern Standby PC uses any available network connection—Wi-Fi, mobile broadband (MBB)/cellular, or wired Ethernet.) And the Modern Standby PC, connected or not, also has very long battery life in its screen-off state, just like a cell phone.

Enabling the Modern Standby user experience requires all of the devices and software in the Modern Standby PC to actively and correctly participate in system power management. Achieving long standby battery life is primarily a function of allowing all devices, plus the core silicon or System on a Chip (SoC), to enter a very low-power idle state. During Modern Standby, the networking subsystem stays connected so that the system can wake and instantly respond to incoming emails or VoIP calls. Enabling the real-time nature of Modern Standby is primarily a function of platform devices waking the SoC for the correct events at the correct times.

All wake sources in the Modern Standby PC are expected to be capable of waking the SoC from its deepest idle power state. Some wake sources should be capable of generating a wake signal for an event that would cause the system display to turn on. The difference between waking the SoC and turning on the display is central to delivering the Modern Standby user experience. The following rules govern platform wake behavior:

-   Wake source operation and scenarios are the same for all Modern Standby PCs, regardless of whether they are based on the x86 or ARM processor architecture.
-   Wake source operation may differ depending on whether the system is plugged in (AC power) or on battery power (DC power). Differences are noted in the tables below.
-   Some wake sources are hardware-dependent, e.g. wake on fingerprint or wake on optical disc drive ejection (some Modern Standby systems may not have a fingerprint reader or optical disc drive). Modern Standby systems are recommended to support all wake scenarios for which they have the necessary hardware.

The remainder of this topic describes the different types of wake sources, along with additional information, such as whether the wake source can turn on a device's display, whether it is enabled by default, and any differences in operation depending on whether a device is on AC or DC power. Please note that the information in this topic applies to systems with Connected Standby enabled. Connected Standby is enabled by selecting "Never" in the following Power & sleep setting:

When my PC is asleep and on battery power, disconnect from the network:
1. Never 
2. Always 
3. Managed by Windows  

Most systems enable Connected Standby by default.  


## Types of wake sources


### Real-time clock (RTC) or always-on timer


The core silicon or SoC chip in a Modern Standby platform has one or more timers that are always powered on that so that Windows can schedule future work and place the SoC into a deep idle state. During standby, the always-on timer reliably wakes the SoC as programmed by the OS.


### Buttons and lid


The system power button is a very common user-initiated wake source in a Modern Standby platform. All Modern Standby PCs must be designed so that the power button is always enabled to send a wake interrupt to the SoC. To deliver an instant-on experience, the power button must cause the SoC to wake from the deepest idle state without delay. Another common user-initiated wake source on clamshell form factor devices is opening the lid, which wakes the SoC. The Windows button is also able to wake the SoC. 


### Communications devices


The Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and mobile broadband (MBB) devices are responsible for delivering the real-time and constant connectivity features of Modern Standby. They facilitate wake sources such as Universal Windows Platform (UWP) Applications notifications and syncing and Bluetooth notifications and syncing.


### Input devices


We recommend using HIDI2C for input peripherals whenever possible for better power efficiency, but this is not a requirement. If necessary, USB can be used to connect to an input device such as a touchpad, touch digitizer, or pen digitizer. A precision touchpad must be capable of waking the system from deep idle, regardless of whether this device is connected to USB or I2C. As an option, a non-precision touchpad can wake the system from deep idle. Touch digitizers and pen digitizers must not wake the system from deep idle.

In addition to buttons on the chassis, a Modern Standby PC might have other input devices physically integrated into the system or attached to the system directly or indirectly through a dock. When the user generates input through an input device, it must always wake the SoC from the deepest idle state and cause the display to turn on.


### Voice input


On devices that are Wake on Voice-capable, voice input of "Hey Cortana" from the user can wake the SoC from the deepest idle state and cause the display to turn on.


### Insertion or removal of a connector or device


When the user inserts or removes certain types of connectors or devices, these events can wake the SoC from the deepest idle state and cause the display to turn on.


### Windows Update


Windows Update can always wake the SoC from the deepest idle state to scan for updates. It can also wake the SoC to download and install updates and restart a device, depending on a device's power source.


### Universal Windows Platform (UWP) Applications 


UWP applications can wake the SoC from the deepest idle state to sync and display notifications, depending on a device's power source, notification priority levels, and app-specific user configurations.


### Remote Access


Remote Desktop and File Sharing can wake the SoC from the deepest idle state on the client system when the system has an Ethernet connection.


### Audio


Audio from internal speakers or Bluetooth speakers can wake the SoC, so that audio continues playing even when a device's screen is off.  


### Environmental context changes


The Modern Standby PC must also respond in real-time to changes in environmental conditions. The common cases are thermal events and power source change events.

**Note** When a device is on AC power, notifications of all priorities from UWP apps will be delivered. When a device is on DC power, high priority, medium priority, and low priority notifications from exempt UWP apps will be delivered. The priority level of different types of notifications is app-specific. For example, Inbox Mail app incoming mail notifications are low priority. For notifications that are delivered during Modern Standby, typically only toast notifications will turn on the display. Raw notifications could also turn on the display, depending on the type of payload they are delivering. For more information about UWP app notifications, please refer to [WNS Notification Priorities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/wns-notification-priorities).

To set an app as exempt, go to Settings > Battery > See which apps are affecting your battery life, select an app and uncheck the "Let Windows decide when this app can run in the background." To allow notifications from apps, ensure Settings > Notifications and Actions > Notifications > "Get notifications from apps and other senders" is enabled. 

Skype is exempt by default. To change settings for Skype incoming calls, go to Settings > System > Notifications and Actions > Notifications > Show reminders and incoming VoIP calls on the lock screen. To change other Skype notification settings, go to Settings > System > Notifications and Actions > Get notifications from these senders > Skype. 

To configure location services settings and see which apps are using geofencing, the user can navigate to Settings > Privacy  > Location. To find out if an app uses geovisits APIs, please contact the app developer.
