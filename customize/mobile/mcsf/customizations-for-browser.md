|:--------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Custom HTTP headers for Microsoft Edge](custom-http-headers-for-internet-explorer.md)    | Partners can configure Microsoft Edge to send custom HTTP headers, in addition to the default HTTP headers, with all HTTP and HTTPS requests. The header is the portion of the HTTP request that defines the form of the message. |
| [Custom user agent string for Microsoft Edge](custom-user-agent-string-for-internet-explorer.md)  | The user agent string indicates which browser you are using, its version number, and details about your system, such as operating system and version. A web server can use this information to provide content that is tailored for your specific browser and phone.  |
| [Default value for browser data saver](default-value-for-browser-data-saver.md)  | Partners can use this customization to configure the default setting for the browser data saver feature by turning the browser optimization service on or off. |
| [Show pictures automatically when browsing](show-pictures-automatically-when-browsing.md) | Partners can enable or disable the Show pictures automatically setting in the browser's advanced settings screen. |
| [Welcome home page for Microsoft Edge](welcome-home-page-for-internet-explorer.md)    | Partners can set the home page that appears the first time that Microsoft Edge is opened. This page is only shown the first time the browser is opened. After that, the browser displays either the most recently viewed page or an empty page if the user has closed all tabs or opens a new tab.    |
| [WinInet ReceiveTimeOut duration](wininet-receivetimeout-duration.md) | In cases where there are issues related to network handovers, partners can increase the WinInet ReceiveTimeOut value to provide more time for the network switch to take place.   |
