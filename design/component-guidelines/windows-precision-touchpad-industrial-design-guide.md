The guidance in this topic ensures that Windows Precision Touchpad interactions are natural and enhance the overall quality of the user experience. Windows Precision Touchpads are built for the user and are seamlessly integrated into a mobile computing experience.

Windows Precision Touchpads are optimized for Windows 8.1. The experience that precision touchpads provide is consistent and reliable, fast and responsive, and avoids issues of accidental activation. This advanced software experience is combined with a hardware certification program and superb industrial design to produce the ideal touchpad experience.

Windows Precision Touchpads are an evolution in touchpad hardware and software technology. This topic does not mandate specific methods or materials, but instead describes the desired end-user experience on precision touchpads. In many cases, this can be achieved by simple enhancements, such as using scratch and smudge resistant coatings. Utilizing advanced manufacturing techniques and materials reinforces the overall quality experience.

Windows Precision Touchpads are designed for mobile form factors, to be used together with touch and optimized for their unique strengths as an input modality. These devices are built and designed for the enjoyment and comfort of the user. Characteristics such as the location and size of the touchpad are designed to be intuitive and easy for everyone to use.
