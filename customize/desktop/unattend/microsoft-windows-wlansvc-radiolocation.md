# RadioLocation


`RadioLocation` provides instructions to users for enabling the wireless local area network (WLAN) hardware. These instructions are displayed when a wireless connectivity problem is detected, for example, when a wireless adapter is turned off.

Use this setting when you are deploying a portable computer with WLAN hardware that can be manually enabled or disabled.

In a typical scenario, a user may deactivate the WLAN hardware by a keyboard command or a physical switch. Later, the user forgets the switch is off, and tries to browse the Internet. WindowsÂ Internet Explorer shows an error page. From this page, the user selects **Diagnose connection problems**. Windows diagnoses the problem, and provides a recommendation to resolve the problem.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Wireless capability on this computer is turned off.</p>
<p>Turn on wireless capability.</p>
<p><em>Use the switch on the front or side of the computer, or function keys if available, to enable wireless capability on this computer.</em></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

The third line in this message can be configured using the `RadioLocation` setting to provide a more specific recommendation.

## Values


<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><em>RadioLocation</em></p></td>
<td><p>Provides user instructions for enabling the WLAN hardware. <code>RadioLocation</code> is a string. The recommended maximum length of the string is 128 characters.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

This string type supports empty elements.

## Applies To


For a list of the Windows editions and architectures that this component supports, see [Microsoft-Windows-Wlansvc](microsoft-windows-wlansvc.md).

## XML Example


This XML example shows how to configure Windows to provide specific instructions on how to activate the WLAN for the fictitious computer, Fabrikam Model FNB1:

```
<RadioLocation>To activate the wireless LAN on the Fabrikam Model FNB1, slide the wireless switch on the left side of the computer to ON.</RadioLocation>
```

This changes the WLAN activation recommendation to:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Wireless capability on this computer is turned off.</p>
<p>Turn on wireless capability.</p>
<p><em>You can do this by using a switch, usually found on the front or side of the computer, or by using a function-key combination.</em></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
