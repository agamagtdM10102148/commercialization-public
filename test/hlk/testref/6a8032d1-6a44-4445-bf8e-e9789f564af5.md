Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Mouse or other Pointing Device Testing Prerequisites](mouse-or-other-pointing-device-testing-prerequisites.md).

The test asks you to validate that the physical height of the touchpad is the same as that reported by the device. You should measure the height of the touchpad by using a ruler, and compare that value to the value that is displayed by the test. If the values match\*, you should manually pass the test. If they do not match, you should fail the test.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> \*Because the digitizer might be slightly smaller than the physical device, the measured height can be as much as 4mm greater than that which is reported by the device.
