# Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures


We recommend that you use this guide as your starting point to troubleshoot Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) test failures. This article describes possible test failures and provides step-by-step instructions on how to troubleshoot them. You must perform the troubleshooting steps in the prescribed order.

**Troubleshooting steps:**

1.  [Install latest updates and filters](#step1)

2.  [Review the Status icons](#reviewstat)

3.  [Make sure that the test was run correctly](#confirmcorrect)

4.  [Check for configuration changes](#configchanges)

5.  [Identify the failure category](#cat)

6.  [Contact Windows HLK Support](#support)

## <span id="step1"></span><span id="STEP1"></span>**1. Install latest updates and filters**


Verify that you have the latest updates and filters for Windows HLK. The test failure might already be resolved by a published filter or update. You can get the latest Windows HLK content at [Windows Hardware Lab Kit Filters](windows-hardware-lab-kit-filters.md).

## <span id="reviewstat"></span><span id="REVIEWSTAT"></span>**2. Review the Status icons**


In Windows HLK Studio, review the test status icons on the **Results** tab. The status icons are described below. To follow the test failure categories that are listed in [5. Identify the failure category](#cat), you must know what each icon represents.

>[!NOTE]
>  If the status icon suggests that you have a Windows HLK infrastructure problem, see [Troubleshooting the Windows HLK Environment](troubleshooting-the-windows-hlk-environment.md).

 

## <span id="confirmcorrect"></span><span id="CONFIRMCORRECT"></span>**3. Make sure that the test was run correctly**


Make sure that the test was run correctly, as described in the following sections:

-   [Verify tests that require special configuration](#specconfig)

-   [Verify manual tests that require user interaction](#userinter)

-   [Run multi-device test as a single test](#multi)

### <span id="specconfig"></span><span id="SPECCONFIG"></span>**Verify tests that require special configuration**

You should check whether the test requires a special configuration and if it does, verify that all special configuration requirements are met.

Some Windows HLK tests require additional files that are not included in the Windows HLK because of size or security reasons. Windows HLK Studio denotes these tests as requiring special configuration. These tests fail if the supplemental data is not installed.

Tests that require special configuration are denoted by a toolbox icon (![special configuration](images/hlk-winb-toolboxicon-commonts.png)) in the **Type** column in the **Test** pane and the **Results** pane in Windows HLK Studio. Special configuration details are described in the test reference topic for each test. For specific test reference documentation, see [HLK Test Reference](../testref/hardware-lab-kit-test-reference.md), or from in Windows HLK Studio, select the specific test on the **Test** tab or the **Result** tab, and then press **F1**.

>[!NOTE]
>  The online version of the help content is generally the most current.

 

### <span id="userinter"></span><span id="USERINTER"></span>**Verify manual tests that require user interaction**

You should determine whether the test requires user interaction.

Tests that require user interaction are denoted by a person icon (![requires user interaction](images/hlk-winb-personicon-commonts.png)) in the **Type** column in the **Test** pane and the **Results** pane in Windows HLK Studio. For instructions on how to run a manual test, see the **Running the test** section in the test reference topic for the particular test. For specific test reference documentation, see [HLK Test Reference](../testref/hardware-lab-kit-test-reference.md), or from in Windows HLK Studio, select the specific test on the **Test** tab or the **Result** tab, and then press **F1**.

### <span id="multi"></span><span id="MULTI"></span>**Run multi-device test as a single test**

If the test was run as a multi-device test, rerun the test as a single test.

Multi-device testing is a Windows HLK feature that is supported by some tests. This feature reduces the time that a test runs by testing multiple devices at the same time (instead of scheduling a separate test run for each device.) Although this is a good way to reduce overall test time, it makes troubleshooting difficult because the results for all devices are logged in the same log files.

If a test fails during a multi-device test run, we recommend that you rerun the test separately against each device and troubleshoot each test run accordingly. To run a test individually in Windows HLK Studio, select the context-menu item **Run Tests Individually**. This menu item is available in the **Results** pane for tests that run as multi-device tests.

## <span id="configchanges"></span><span id="CONFIGCHANGES"></span>**4. Check for configuration changes**


Confirm that the Windows HLK infrastructure or the device configuration did not change after you selected the test target. Windows HLK gets the Windows HLK Client system configuration information when you select the test target. If you change the system or device configuration after you select the test target, you must then re-select the test target.

> [!WARNING]
> 
> Be aware that re-selecting the test target invalidates and removes all previous test results. We highly recommend that you do not make any device or infrastructure changes after you have started testing.

 

Watch a video demonstration.

## <span id="cat"></span><span id="CAT"></span>**5. Identify the failure category**


The **Results** tab in Windows HLK Studio lists test tasks in the order in which they were run. Failed tests include error options that you can use to help troubleshoot test failures. For more information about the **Results** tab, see **Manage Test Results using Result Tab**.

The following table describes test categories and their indicators; the failure category column links to troubleshooting assistance in this article. To access test errors, execution logs, tasks logs, and additional associated files, right-click the failed test on the Windows HLK Studio **Results** tab.

For additional information about specific error messages, see [Windows HLK Studio task error message reference](#errorref).

The following sections fully describe the failure categories that are listed in the preceding table:

-   [Test failed because of test results](#results)

-   [Test fails with no failing task and Execution Logs are disabled](#exelogs)

-   [System crashed](#sysx)

-   [Test crashed](#testx)

-   [Test was cancelled because it ran too long](#toolong)

-   [Client system is unresponsive](#clientunre)

### <span id="results"></span><span id="RESULTS"></span>**Test failed because of test results**

Test result failures are the most common kind of failure. If you receive a test result failure, review the following information:

-   The **Task Log** file and **Additional Files** from the **Results** tab in Windows HLK Studio.

-   The **Troubleshooting** section in the test reference topic. Select the test in Windows HLK Studio and then press **F1**.

-   The associated technology-specific troubleshooting guide that contains general troubleshooting guidance for all tests in a particular feature or technology area. For a list of technology-specific troubleshooting guides, see [Troubleshooting Windows HLK](troubleshooting-windows-hlk.md).

### <span id="exelogs"></span><span id="EXELOGS"></span>**Test fails with no failing task and Execution Logs are disabled**

A known HLK client issue can cause a test to fail when there are no failing tasks, but one or more of the tasks is marked as cancelled. The test result should be checked for Execution Logs.

***<em>To check for execution logs</em>***

1.  In Windows HLK Studio, right click a task result from the failing test result.

2.  Use the **Infrastructure** menu item to view the types of logs.

3.  Check whether the **Execution Logs** option is disabled (greyed out).

If the Execution Logs are missing this failure is likely caused by the known issue. The work-around is to re-run the test, so that logs are copied back to the controller.

### <span id="sysx"></span><span id="SYSX"></span>**System crashed**

When Windows encounters a condition that compromises safe system operation, the system halts. This condition is commonly called a *bug check*, a *system crash*, a *kernel error*, a *Stop error*, or *BSOD*. A hardware device, its driver, or related software can cause this error.

### <span id="Bugcheck_summary_information"></span><span id="bugcheck_summary_information"></span><span id="BUGCHECK_SUMMARY_INFORMATION"></span>**Bugcheck summary information**

The system crash icon (![system crash icon](images/status-icon-failed-bug-check.png)) indicates that the system crashed during the test run. You can right-click on a test associated with a system crash to view associated Bugcheck information:

![bugcheck summary information dialog](images/results-tab-system-crash-3.png)

### <span id="Copying_crash_dump_files_from_the_client_machine_back_to_the_HLK_Controller"></span><span id="copying_crash_dump_files_from_the_client_machine_back_to_the_hlk_controller"></span><span id="COPYING_CRASH_DUMP_FILES_FROM_THE_CLIENT_MACHINE_BACK_TO_THE_HLK_CONTROLLER"></span>**Copying crash dump files from the client machine back to the HLK Controller**

In the **Configuration** tab of HLK Studio, the **Crash Dump Copy Back Setting** specifies whether to copy the kernel dump back to the HLK Controller.

>[!NOTE]
>  Copying is disabled by default. For more information, see [Manually Configure HLK Client Kernel Debugger Settings](manually-configure-hlk-client-kernel-debugger-settings.md).

 

When Windows crashes, it writes an event to the Windows System Event Log. To start the Event Viewer and view the event, do the following:

1.  On the **Start** screen, type **Event Logs**.

2.  Under **Settings**, click **View Event Log**.

3.  In the Event Log Viewer, select **Windows Logs**.

4.  Select the specific log of interest. To troubleshoot most user-mode failures, including problems with Windows HLK tests, select **Application Log**. For kernel-mode issues, select **System Log**.

5.  In the Windows System Event Log file, look for an event that is similar to the following:

    ``` syntax
    Level = Critical
    Source = Kernel-Power 
    Event ID 41 
    Description:
    The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.
                                                
    ```

### <span id="Analyzing_crash_dump_files"></span><span id="analyzing_crash_dump_files"></span><span id="ANALYZING_CRASH_DUMP_FILES"></span>**Analyzing crash dump files**

In addition to the Bugcheck summary information dialog, you can debug a system crash by using the crash dump file and the Windows debugger. For information on how to analyze crash dump files see [Crash Dump Files](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=294097) and [Analyzing a Kernel-Mode Dump File](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=293842). For Windows debugging tools, see [Troubleshooting Windows HLK](troubleshooting-windows-hlk.md#addlres).

You must determine whether the crash is caused by the driver that you are trying to certify or whether it is a Windows problem. You can identify this by using the Windows debugger **!analyze** extension. In the kernel debugger, use the **!analyze -v** command to review data on the failing component.

For more information about how to use the **!analyze** extension, see [Using the !analyze Extension](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=293845). For advanced troubleshooting assistance, see [Debugging Techniques](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=293846). For more information about bug checks, see [Interpreting a Bug Check Code](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=290756). For a list of bug check error codes, see [Bug Check Code Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=290758).

If the problem is caused by Windows, collect the dump file and debugging data and follow the instructions in [Windows HLK Support](windows-hlk-support.md).

### <span id="testx"></span><span id="TESTX"></span>**Test crashed**

Tests in this category show up as test failures that have no **Task Logs** files. Start the Windows Event Viewer on the client computer. (To start Windows Event Viewer, on the **Start** screen, type **Event Logs** and then select **View Event Log** under **Settings**.) In the Windows Event Viewer, in the **Windows Application** event log, look for an event that is similar to the following:

``` syntax
Level      = ErrorSource     = Application ErrorEvent ID   = 1000Description: Faulting application name: Testname.exe, … 
```

Collect the-user mode crash dumps as described in [Collecting User-Mode Dumps](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=257798), and submit them as instructed in [Windows HLK Support](windows-hlk-support.md).

### <span id="toolong"></span><span id="TOOLONG"></span>**Test was cancelled because it ran too long**

Windows HLK automatically cancels a test run if the test is still running after three times the expected runtime. Windows HLK Studio displays the estimated test run time for each test.

You can identify tests that were cancelled because they ran too long by using the following criteria:

-   Test does not have associated Task Logs.

-   Test does not have a **Task Error** in Windows HLK Studio.

-   In the **WttEa.log** file, under **Infrastructure\\Execution Log**, look for the error: **Run Test Failed Because the Task With TaskTimeout**, as shown in the following example:

    ``` syntax
    1872 3868 2012:3:3 3:43:7:898 Error: 0x8201adb1, Error 0x8201adb1   CExecutionTask::Cleanup()::(null)::CAUSE:INFORMATION: Task "Run Test" Failed Because the Task With TaskTimeout Flag Was running after the Timeout period 10800000 MilliSeconds    File=d:\branches\fbl\tools\wtt\rel25\dtm\sdktools\wtt\jobs\runtime\wttexecutionagent\coreea\executiontask\src\executiontask.cpp Line=1686
    ```

**To view the Wttea.log file by using Windows HLK Studio**

1.  In Windows HLK Studio, click the **Results** tab.

2.  Right-click the failed test.

3.  Click **Infrastructure**, click **Execution Logs**, and then click **WttEa.log**.

Verify that the basic functionality of the device still works.

### <span id="clientunre"></span><span id="CLIENTUNRE"></span>**Client system is unresponsive**

Use the **Job Monitor** in Windows HLK Manager to view the **Last Heartbeat** column in the **Machine** window. If the last heartbeat has not registered for a long time, a communication problem probably exists between the Windows HLK Controller and the Windows HLK Client. If there is no heartbeat from the Windows HLK Client, it can take a long time for a test to be cancelled. To troubleshoot this problem, consider the following issues:

-   Network problems. See [Troubleshooting the Windows HLK Environment](troubleshooting-the-windows-hlk-environment.md).

-   Client system is unresponsive. This state is indicated in the following ways:

    -   The mouse pointer moves, but it cannot perform any actions.

    -   All video is frozen; the mouse pointer does not move; paging continues.

    -   The mouse, keyboard, and disk are all unresponsive.

    If the test appears to be making progress but the progress is slow, review console logging to determine the cause.

    Enable the system for debugging and follow the instructions in [Forcing a System Crash](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=293838) and [Debugging a Stalled System](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=294096).

    Driver developers should investigate these issues by using a kernel debugger. If the test is nonresponsive, start the kernel debugger before Windows HLK cancels the test run. In the kernel debugger, look for any unresponsive threads in the test process.

## <span id="support"></span><span id="SUPPORT"></span>**6. Contact Windows HLK Support**


See [Windows HLK Support](windows-hlk-support.md) for instructions on how to report the following problems to Windows HLK Support:

-   An inaccurate status icon is reported.

-   You cannot determine the cause of the failure.

-   The failure is caused by a system crash that you cannot resolve.

-   The failure is caused by a Windows problem.

### <span id="collect"></span><span id="COLLECT"></span>**How to get the test name**

To get the test name in Windows HLK Studio, perform the following steps:

1.  On the **Results** tab in Windows HLK Studio, right-click the test name.

2.  Type **Ctrl-C** to copy the test data into the clipboard.

3.  Paste the test data into Notepad or other text editor. The data will be similar to *Figure 2. Sample Test Data*, where **DF - PNP (disable and enable) with IO Before and After (Basic)** is the test name, **03m** is the anticipated test runtime, **USB Input Device** is the device under test, and **MYSYSTEM** is the name of the Windows HLK Client.

    ![sample test data](images/hlk-winb-fig3-sampletestdata-commonts.png)

## <span id="errorref"></span><span id="ERRORREF"></span>**Windows HLK Studio task error message reference**


This section describes task error messages that Windows HLK Studio returns for some test failures.

### <span id="markedasfailed"></span><span id="MARKEDASFAILED"></span>Task &lt;&gt; is Marked as Failed from the Log File

This is the most common error message. Review the Task Log file.

### <span id="fail2determine"></span><span id="FAIL2DETERMINE"></span>Failed to determine Pass/Fail of the task &lt;&gt; Task will be marked as failed anyway.

This error usually means that the test generated a log, but did not log anything other than comments. Some log failures do not result in a Task Error. The Log indicates a failure or the Log is incomplete.

### <span id="exitcode"></span><span id="EXITCODE"></span>Cause : The Execute Task with &lt;&gt; Failed with ExitCode &lt;Error Code&gt;

Not all Tasks return logs; failure is indicated by exe exit code. This code can be any error typ. Determine whether the error code makes sense for a win32 error or a HRESULT error.

### <span id="unexreboot"></span><span id="UNEXREBOOT"></span>Task cancelled because of an unexpected reboot

This is a general error that can have various causes, including but not limited to the system under test rebooting or crashing.

## <span id="troubleshooting_graphics"></span><span id="TROUBLESHOOTING_GRAPHICS"></span>**Troubleshooting graphics tests**


**Graphics Support CABs**

Graphics Feature on Demand (FOD) packages are required to be present on the test client for all graphics testing. The DLLs for the\\\\BUILD OS are available for download on the MSDN on the HLK Supplemental Content download page. The cabs can be deployed on a running client, or injected into the OS image prior to deploying to the client.

For example, to install on a running client, use the following command:

``` syntax
dism /online /add-package /packagepath:<path to package>\Microsoft-OneCore-Graphics-Tools-Package.cab
```
