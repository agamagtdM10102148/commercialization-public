<p>Optionally, an OEM or mobile operator may also preload an additional 4 apps that can be subroutined and called from a main app. In this case, the partner specifies one of the apps as the hub app (main app), which will be automatically launched at the end of setup. This app can then invoke other spoke apps (subroutined apps) to complete other tasks.</p></td>

<td><p>OEMs can customize the default home country/region that shows up during OOBE in cases where the SIM PIN is turned on. This value is associated with the default ICCID values. When SIM PIN is turned off, the OS uses the MCC-derived country/region instead.</p></td>
