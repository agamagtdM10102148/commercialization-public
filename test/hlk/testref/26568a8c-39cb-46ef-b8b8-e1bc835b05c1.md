This automated test verifies the driver reports mandatory OIDs as supported

>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft will be accepting 802.11ad WDI drivers for HLK certification for the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709) to facilitate broad distribution and testing among Windows Insiders and ecosystem partners. However, due to the lack of broad testing of 802.11ad WDI functionality, this feature is enabled as a developer preview for the Windows 10, version 1709 release. 
>
>If a problem is encountered with 802.11ad functionality, please contact your 802.11ad IHV partner for support assistance.   Microsoft is committed to supporting 802.11ad Wi-Fi connectivity in a future version of Windows 10 in order to enable wireless docking and other scenarios.

Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Wireless LAN (802.11) Testing Prerequisites](wireless-lan--80211--testing-prerequisites.md).

The test completes the following:

-   Queries NDIS for all implemented OIDs that the driver returned during miniport initialization.

-   Compares the resulting list against all required OIDS listed here: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff571095(v=vs.85).aspx>.

The test will fail if any of the required OIDs listed on MSDN are not reported by the driver during miniport initialization.
