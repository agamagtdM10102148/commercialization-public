Users can log in with a look or a touch, with no need for a password. In conjunction with Microsoft Passport, biometric authentication uses fingerprints or facial recognition and is more secure, more personal, and more convenient. Windows Hello can even give users a friendly hello and greet them by name.</p></td>

In Modern Standby, the PC uses the S0 low power idle model. Modern Standby has the flexibility to configure the default behavior to limit network activity while in the low power state.</p></td>
