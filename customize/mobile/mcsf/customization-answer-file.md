# Customization answer file


A **customization answer file** is an XML file that you write based on the MCSF schema. OEMs can use the MCSF customization answer file to specify the settings and variants for a custom mobile OS image. The customization answer file allows for a broader integration across the OS by providing OEMs with a single place to define nearly all mobile OS settings.

When creating or working with customization answer files, keep the following design requirements and considerations in mind:

-   If you are using ImgGen.cmd to generate a mobile OS image, you can only specify one customization answer file. For more information, see [Building a mobile image using ImgGen.cmd](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/mobile/building-a-phone-image-using-imggencmd).

-   Depending on what you want to do, you can use the customization answer file to create a package containing your customization(s) or use the answer file as one of the inputs to create an OS image.

    -   To use the customization answer file to generate a package without building an OS image, see [Generating customization packages without creating an image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/mobile/building-a-phone-image-using-imggencmd#generating-customization-packages-without-creating-an-image).

    -   To build an image as an .ffu file using the customization answer file as one of the inputs, see [Using ImgGen.cmd to generate the image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/mobile/building-a-phone-image-using-imggencmd#a-href-idusingimggenausing-imggencmd-to-generate-the-image).

-   The values used in the root customization answer file (or the one you specify as the input customization answer file during ImgGen.cmd or CustomizationGen.cmd in Step 6) is used to determine the package owner so it is important to provide values for the following attributes:

    -   **Name**

    -   **Description**

    -   **Owner**

    -   **OwnerType** (in the customization samples this is typically already set to 'OEM').

    -   Any files, assets, or other settings specific to the customization

-   Absolute or full paths to file sources, such as imports, assets and data files, are required. This means that whenever you specify the **Source** attribute value for a file **Import**, **Asset**, or **DataAsset**, the path must be absolute.

-   File source paths may contain **$(environment\_variables)**. Note that you can only use environment variables when referencing files. This will not work when configuring **Setting** values.

-   Using %this\_format% in customization answer files is not allowed and results in an error.

-   The source path for **Import** files may contain the macro, **$(CurrentFileDir)**.

-   **Import** source files can use environment variables in the file name. However, other source file names cannot use environment variables.

## <a href="" id="customizationanswerfilesamples"></a>Sample customization answer files


You can use as reference the sample OEM customization answer file located in the %WPDKCONTENTROOT%\\Samples\\Customization directory. This answer file shows several configured customizations and it imports two answer files that contain real connection settings data for AT&T and T-Mobile.

### Sample 1

The following sample customization answer file shows how to:

-   Specify other customization answer files to import from the root answer file.

-   Define **Targets** or conditions for when a variant can be applied.

-   Define **Static** settings and data, which are installed for all images, regardless of the variant.

-   Define settings for a **Variant**, which are applied if the associated target's conditions are met.

### Sample 2

The following sample customization answer file snippet shows how to:

-   Define a **Static** variant

-   Specify the customizations for a specific mobile operator in a **Variant** section.

```XML
<!-- Variant Section -->

  <!-- Example of a static variant. There are no TargetRefs. -->

  <Static>
    <!-- Asset data to be copied to the device. A small set of approved destinations are allowed.
         Only allowed in the static settings -->
    <DataAssets>
      <DataAsset Source="C:\Customization\Assets\OEMMap_USA.map" Type="MapData" />
    </DataAssets>
  </Static>

  <!-- Simple example of some things to do on a hypothetical TinyMO. Setting the Boot Screen 
       on FirstSIM, and the MMS Gateway whenever the SIM is detected as "Newly Inserted". Ringtones and
       wallpapers are also added. -->

  <Variant Name="TinyMO Settings">
    <TargetRefs>
      <TargetRef Id="SIM_TinyMO" />
    </TargetRefs>

    <Settings Path="Connectivity">
      <Setting Name="MMSGateway" Value="123.tinymo.com" />
    </Settings>

    <Settings Path="EventSounds">
      <Asset Name="Ringtones" Source="C:\Assets\Ringtones\Ringtone1.wma" />
      <Asset Name="Ringtones" Source="C:\Assets\Ringtones\Ringtone2.wma" />
      <Asset Name="Ringtones" Source="C:\Assets\Ringtones\Ringtone3.wma" />
      <Setting Name="DefaultRingtone" Value="Ringtone1.wma" />
    </Settings>

    <Settings Path="LockScreen">
      <Asset Name="Wallpapers" Source="C:\Assets\Wallpapers\Lockscreen1.jpg" />
      <Asset Name="Wallpapers" Source="C:\Assets\Wallpapers\Lockscreen2.png" />
      <Asset Name="Wallpapers" Source="C:\Assets\Wallpapers\Lockscreen3.jpeg" />
      <Setting Name="DefaultWallpaper" Value="Lockscreen2.png" />
    </Settings>

  </Variant>
```

<p>OEMs can use the following optional attributes:</p>
<p><strong>TargetFileName</strong> can be used to set the name of the file on the device. If there is no <strong>TargetFileName</strong> specified, the source name is used.</p>
<p><strong>DisplayName</strong> can be used by some settings to display a name such as the ringtone’s display name. The setting determines exactly how this property is used and is a passthrough to a registry value.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong> is a flag that indicates the type of asset, as required by some settings. In Windows Phone 8.1, <strong>MO</strong> and <strong>OEM</strong> are supported. If no value is specified, the default value is OEM.</p></td>

## Specifying data values in customization answer files


When creating your customization answer file, certain values must be specified in a specific format. These are as follows:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Type value</th>
<th>Value attribute</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>REG_DWORD</p></td>
<td><p>Decimal: 1</p>
<p>- or -</p>
<p>Hexadecimal: 0x1</p></td>
<td><p>32-bit number presented in either decimal or hexadecimal format.</p>
<p>All hexadecimal values in the customization answer file must be prefixed with <strong>0x</strong>. For example, if the hexadecimal value that you need to specify is 1, you must set the <strong>Value</strong> in the customization answer file to <strong>0x1</strong>. These values are in little-endian format where the multibyte value is stored in memory from lowest byte (the &quot;little end&quot;) to the highest byte. For example, 0x12345678 is stored as (0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12) in little-endian format.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Options defined in the policy settings files. For example:</p>
<p>&lt;Validate&gt;</p>
<p>   &lt;Option Value=&quot;0&quot; FriendlyName=&quot;Red&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>   &lt;Option Value=&quot;1&quot; FriendlyName=&quot;Green&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>   &lt;Option Value=&quot;2&quot; FriendlyName=&quot;Blue&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/Validate&gt;</p></td>
<td><p>0 or Red</p>
<p>1 or Green</p>
<p>2 or Blue</p></td>
<td><p>Use the enumerated value. For example, either the enumerated value 0 or its equivalent friendly name &quot;Red&quot; can be specified.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>REG_MULTI_SZ</p></td>
<td><p>Red.png;Green.png;Blue.png</p></td>
<td><p>Multiple text strings separated by a semicolon &#39;<strong>;</strong>&#39;.</p>
<p>A &#39;<strong>;</strong>&#39; is used as the delimeter for REG_MULTI_SZ so this character cannot be used inside the string because it will be parsed as the separator of two strings.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>REG_BINARY</p></td>
<td><p>E8,03</p>
<p>(which corresponds to 0x03E8 hexadecimal)</p></td>
<td><p>Byte array in hexadecimal format, separated by a comma &#39;<strong>,</strong>&#39;.</p>
<p>Do not add the 0x prefix when specifying this type of registry value in the customization answer file.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



## Targets


When creating a customization answer file, OEMs can define **Targets** to describe keying for a variant. Targets for variants must be described or pre-declared before being referenced by the variant. OEMs can use the same target in multiple variants to enable reuse. Within a target, if the device meets any of the target states, the settings will be applied (the states are **OR**'ed together). The conditions within the states are **AND**'ed together and all of the conditions must be met in order for a state to be true.

In the previous XML sample, a SIM target is defined through MNC/MCC pairs. The following example shows how the SIM targets may be defined:

```XML
<Targets>
    <Target Id="SIM_TinyMO">
        <TargetState>
            <Condition Name="MNC" Value="123" />
            <Condition Name="MCC" Value="456" />
        </TargetState>
        <TargetState>
            <Condition Name="MNC" Value="456" />
            <Condition Name="MCC" Value="123" />
        </TargetState>
    </Target>
</Targets>
```

### <a href="" id="extensionprovisioningkeys"></a>Extension provisioning keys

OEMs can use custom CSPs as conditions by listing the name/path in the **Name** attribute and the desired value to pass to the CSP to check against. 

## <a href="" id="importingothercustomizationanswerfiles"></a>Importing other customization answer files


A customization answer file can be used to import other customization answer files that, when merged, form a single set of customizations and variants to be applied to the OS image.

### Priority order for imported customization answer files

When importing customization answer files, if there are any settings that are defined twice, the custom image will not build unless a priority within the imported answer files are specified to determine the overwrite order. To specify the overwrite order, the header for customization answer files contain an optional **Priority** attribute, which determines the order that settings will be overwritten if imported files contain a setting defined more than once. Generally, the highest priority will have its value used for customization package creation. If files have the same priority and define the same setting, the image fails to build.

To add the priority order for the imported answer file, set the **Priority** attribute within the **ImageCustomizations** block of the customization answer file to be imported. The following example shows how to do this:

```XML
<ImageCustomizations xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/embedded/2004/10/ImageUpdate"
                  Name="Settings Input"
                  Description="Settings for image build"
                  Owner="Contoso"
                  OwnerType="OEM"
                  Priority="2">
```

**Note**  
When setting **Priority**, 1 is the highest, and zero (0) and negative numbers are not allowed.



### Specifying files to be imported

The following code example shows how you can specify other customization answer files to be imported. The **Imports** element must be specified in the root customization answer file.

```XML
  <Imports>
    <Import Source="C:\Customization\SampleOperators.xml" />
    <Import Source="C:\Customization\SampleBrandCommon.xml" />
  </Imports>
```

## <a href="" id="appspreloadingstoragelocation"></a>Apps: Preloading and storage location


OEMs can preload apps using the following customization answer file code snippet:

```XML
    <Applications>
      <Application Source="C:\Customization\TestData\apps\OEMMOApp.xap"
                   License="C:\Customization\TestData\apps\OEMMOApp_License.xml"
                   ProvXML="C:\Customization\TestData\apps\MPAP_OEMMOApp_01.provxml" />
    </Applications>
```

**Note**  
The AppPreInstaller is specifically looking for provXML files with the filename pattern **MPAP\_\*\_\*.provxml** so make sure your file names are correctly formatted.



The following table describes where preloaded apps are stored on the device:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>First option</th>
<th>Alternative option</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Default</p></td>
<td><p>Main OS</p></td>
<td><p>Data</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Variant</p></td>
<td><p>Data</p></td>
<td><p>Main OS</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



All applications can be uninstalled by the user. When applications are uninstalled, the application files remain on the device, but these are not shown in the application list. During a cold boot, or when the user selects **Reset my phone**, apps in the Data partition will be removed while apps in the MainOS partition will be reinstalled. Users can also install apps to the SD card. When the phone boots with an SD card, the user is given an option to select the install location.

## <a href="" id="collisionsoverrides"></a>Collisions and overrides


If there are collisions or overrides, **Settings** groups are treated as a Condition-Setting Path pair. This means that two settings using the same path but different conditions are considered unique, as are two settings with the same condition but different paths.

When two different files set the same unique **Settings** group, the following rules are used by the image customization process to resolve collisions or overrides:

-   A file may overwrite a unique item that is defined by any file it imports. For example, the imports sample in the previous section, SampleDevice.customizations.xml, can be used to override the theme color set in SampleBrandCommon.xml.

-   Two files imported by the same file cannot set the same unique item. For example, if SampleOperators.xml and SampleBrandCommon.xml both set the same theme color using the same condition, an error will occur and a message will be displayed to indicate that the value cannot be imported because both files define the same value.
