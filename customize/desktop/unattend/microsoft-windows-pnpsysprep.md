# Microsoft-Windows-PnpSysprep

The Microsoft-Windows-PnpSysprep component specifies whether all Plug and Play information persists during the generalize configuration pass and the specialize configuration pass.

Typically, during the **generalize** configuration pass, all device information is removed from the reference computer.

During the **specialize** configuration pass, any Plug and Play devices that are detected on the destination computer are re-initialized. Any Plug and Play devices that are not detected are removed from the computer.
