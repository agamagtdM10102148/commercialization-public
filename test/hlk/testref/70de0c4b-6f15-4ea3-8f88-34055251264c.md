These sets of tests validate cameras functionality with the MF and IMFCaptureEngine.

- **Camera Driver Basic Tests - \\***

  Tests against a subset of camera media types and shorter duration of tests than functional or reliability.

- **Camera Driver Functional Tests - \\***

  Tests against a larger set of media types and have longer duration of the test.

- **Camera Driver Reliability Tests - \\***

  Tests against a larger set of media types and have longer duration of the test, and more complex scenarios.

- **\*- Image Stream - \\***

  Validates that the system is able to take photo from MF\_CAPTURE\_ENGINE\_PREFERRED\_SOURCE\_STREAM\_FOR\_IMAGE.

The test allows for 9-10 seconds for each operation before failing. Mediatype change can include pin tear down and bring up time.</p>
