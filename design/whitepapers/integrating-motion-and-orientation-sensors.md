This paper is intended to help OEMs, ODMs, and IHVs understand motion and orientation sensor capabilities and requirements for Windows 10 and earlier operating systems. The paper also shows how these capabilities are engineered and implemented on PC hardware platforms running Windows. This technology area involves 3D accelerometer, 3D magnetometer/compass, and 3D gyrometer sensor hardware.

This paper does not cover application development or sensor technology that is not directly related to orientation and motion detection.
