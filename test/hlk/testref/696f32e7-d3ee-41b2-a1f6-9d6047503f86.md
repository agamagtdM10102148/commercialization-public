This automated test verifies block storage management on a Storage Area Network (SAN) device. It does this by testing Storage Management API (SMAPI) connectivity from the SAN device (iSCSI target) to the HLK client computer (iSCSI initiator) through a storage provider.

Before running the test, you'll need the following:

-   Hardware
    -   A SAN array (and its provider) connected as an iSCSI target with the HLK client computer acting as the iSCSI initiator.
    -   Ethernet connectivity between the SAN array/provider and the host (HLK client computer).
-   Software
    -   The Windows Standards-Based Storage Management feature. If this package is not installed, the test will automatically install it. The HLK client computer requires internet connectivity for the package to be installed.
    -   The Microsoft iSCSI Initiator Service (MSiSCSI). This service comes preinstalled on the Windows operating system. If for any reason this is not installed, install it manually. The test will automatically start the MSiSCSI service if it is not running.

For this test, you must configure a SAN array connected as an iSCSI target to an iSCSI initiator (which is the HLK client computer in this case). The HLK client computer must have the Microsoft iSCSI Initiator Service installed. This service is preinstalled on a Windows operating system. If this service is not running, the test will automatically start the service.

These SAN arrays are not directly connected to host. They connect to the host through a storage provider. A storage provider can provide connectivity to one or more storage arrays.

The test requires a set of parameters to be passed before running the test. These parameters are specific to the SAN array and how it is connected to the host. The following section provides parameter details.

For generic troubleshooting of HLK test failures, see [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md).

A value of 0 indicates that the test was successful. A value of 1 indicates that the test failed. The HLK controller will capture this return code, and will show whether the HLK job passed or failed.

Review the test log files saved at TestDestFolder referenced in the parameter list on the HLK client computer, and fix the setup issue that is causing the test to fail.
