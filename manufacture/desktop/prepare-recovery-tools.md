# Prepare recovery tools for your Windows images

> [!Tip]
> If you want to reset a computer that runs Windows 10, see [Recovery options in Windows 10](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options).

OEMs: When you create custom Windows 10 and Windows Server images, update the recovery tools.

## [Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE)](windows-recovery-environment--windows-re--technical-reference.md)
Both Windows 10 and Windows Server include a recovery environment that can repair common causes of unbootable operating systems.

Some customizations that you add to Windows should also be added to Windows RE:

| Customization | What do I need to update? | 
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Boot-critical drivers** or **languages** | If you add these to your Windows image, [add those same drivers and languages (when available) to Windows RE](customize-windows-re.md). |
| **Custom recovery tools** | [Add a custom tool to the Windows RE boot options menu](add-a-custom-tool-to-the-windows-re-boot-options-menu.md) | 
| **Dedicated hardware button** | [Add a dedicated hardware button to boot immediately to WinRE](add-a-hardware-recovery-button-to-start-windows-re.md) |

More options:

* [Deploy Windows RE](deploy-windows-re.md): If you're deploying Windows using a .wim file, use these instrutions to deploy the recovery partition and hide the recovery drive letters.



## [Push-button reset](push-button-reset-overview.md)
Windows 10 users can reset their device, either keeping data and apps intact or resetting it for a new user. 

With a separate **bare-metal reset** USB key, users can reset their devices even when replacing the hard drive.

Some customizations that you add to Windows should also be added to the push-button reset tools:

| Customization | What do I need to update? |
|------------|---------------------------|
|**Universal Windows apps** | Automatically restored. |
| **Drivers** installed using an .inf file | Automatically restored. |
| **Windows desktop apps**, or **drivers** installed using an .exe file | [Capture into a provisioning package](deploy-push-button-reset-features.md). (Apps and drivers installed as [siloed provisioning packages (SPPs)](siloed-provisioning-packages.md) are automatically restored.)|
| **Out of Box Experience customizations**, the **Start Menu**, and **Unattend.xml settings** | In Windows 10, version 1809, save a copy in your [Auto-apply folders](recovery-strategy-for-common-customizations.md#auto-apply). In earlier versions or as an alternative, use [extensibility scripts](recovery-strategy-for-common-customizations.md#restoring_settings_using_unattend.xml_and_extensibility_scripts) instead. |
| **Drive partitions** | If your device uses a non-standard drive partition layout, [update bare-metal reset so users can create their own recovery media](bare-metal-resetrecovery-enable-your-users-to-create-media-and-to-recover-hard-drive-space.md). |
| Ship **USB recovery media** to customers | [Bare metal reset/recovery: create recovery media while deploying new devices](create-media-to-run-push-button-reset-features-s14.md). |

More options: 

* Use [Compact OS, single-sourcing, and image optimization](compact-os.md) to save space on the disk.
