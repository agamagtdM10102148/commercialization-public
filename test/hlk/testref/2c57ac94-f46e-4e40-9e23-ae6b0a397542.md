This automated test creates a wireless profile for a network that does not exist and tries to connect to the non-existent network.

>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft will be accepting 802.11ad WDI drivers for HLK certification for the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709) to facilitate broad distribution and testing among Windows Insiders and ecosystem partners. However, due to the lack of broad testing of 802.11ad WDI functionality, this feature is enabled as a developer preview for the Windows 10, version 1709 release. 
>
>If a problem is encountered with 802.11ad functionality, please contact your 802.11ad IHV partner for support assistance.   Microsoft is committed to supporting 802.11ad Wi-Fi connectivity in a future version of Windows 10 in order to enable wireless docking and other scenarios.

Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Wireless LAN (802.11) Testing Prerequisites](wireless-lan--80211--testing-prerequisites.md).

This test will do the following:

-   Create a wireless profile for a network that does not exist.

-   Instruct the wireless service to connect to the created profile The device/driver is expected to quickly fail since the network is not visible.

-   If the connection start event is not seen within ten seconds, the test will fail.

-   If the associating message is not seen within eight seconds of connection start, the test will fail.

-   If the connection failure message is not seen within eight seconds of associating, the test will fail.
