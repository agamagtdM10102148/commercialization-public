# <span id="p_hlk_test.85b27711-7d23-48ba-a951-9ee5336921f3"></span>Hybrid Direct Flash Access Test


This test checks the behavior of the disk drive when flash is being written to. This will ensure in low power scenarios the disk does not spend time spinning up the drive needlessly. The test does (for each priority): Spin down the disk using a STANDBY\_IMMEDIATE command After waiting, check to make sure the disk is spun down. Write to the disk at priority Read the same data that was just written. Check power state to see that it's still spun down. Check to make sure none of the I/O appeared to incur a spinup (2 second I/O) This will loop and repeat the write, starting at 256 KB, increasing to 32 MB at 1 MB chunks over the same starting offset.
