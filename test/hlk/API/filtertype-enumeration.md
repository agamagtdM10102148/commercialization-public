<td><p>This enum identifies a filer as being of type Auto Triage. In this case, the filter provides additional troubleshooting information that can be viewed by the tester.

<tr class="even">
<td><p>Contingency</p></td>
<td><p>This enum identifies a filer as being of type Contingency. A contingency is granted to Microsoft partners due to partial hardware or driver implementation issues and once applied it enables failed results to be submitted as if the tests passed.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Errata</p></td>
<td><p>This enum identifies a filer as being of type Errata. This type of filter is applied to tests that fail due to known test issues, and enables failed results to be submitted as if the tests passed.</p></td>
