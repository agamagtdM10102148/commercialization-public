The Printable Area test generates two single sheets, a portrait sheet and a landscape sheet). You should run this test on different paper sizes, such as A4, Letter, Envelope 10, and A5.

Check the following points in the print area test:

-   Four separate lines are drawn. Each one runs beyond the clipped region. (Each one must be 2 inches larger than the HORZRES and VERTRES properties produce).

-   Diagonals are drawn in this rectangle to identify the page center and to facilitate debugging if the reported printable region is incorrect.

-   A second rectangle is drawn to be 1 inch from the physical edge of the page.

-   A 2-inch square is centered horizontally on the page, 1 inch from the top printable region.

-   A line of text is added to indicate the paper size and page orientation and should be centered on the page's printable area.
