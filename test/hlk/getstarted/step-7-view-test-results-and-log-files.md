# Step 7: View test results and log files


The **Results** tab displays detailed information about each test. As each test completes, the status column updates with the result--pass or fail.

The following image shows the Studio **Results** tab.

If a test fails, you can expand the test details to review the associated log file.

1.  From the list, select a failed test, indicated by a red X or the system crash icon (![system crash icon](images/test-fail-bugcheck-icon.png)).

2.  Expand the **Test Name** node, expand the **Logs** node, and then double-click the log file.

    You can review these log files:

    -   **.log file.** Text dump.

    -   **.wtl file.** Open to view error reports.

    -   **.xml file.** Change file name extension to .wtl to view error reports.

Right-click any test to see additional test details, including:

- [Bugcheck Summary information](../user/hlk-studio---results-tab.md#sysx) for system crashes that occur during test runs

- Task logs

- Additional files

- Applied filters

- Errors

- Infrastructure (gather and execution logs)

To learn more about the different options on this page, including distributed and multi-device support, see [HLK Studio - Results Tab](../user/hlk-studio---results-tab.md).

You can now export a failed job and re-run it on a machine that does not have the HLK Client installed. For more information, see [Exporting a Failed HLK Job](../user/exporting-a-failed-hlk-job.md).
