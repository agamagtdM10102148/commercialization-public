# <span id="p_hlk_test.437516a6-ab8c-424b-a34b-3b5c7df32b9e"></span>WLAN Wake - Packet Tests - Functional


This automated test validates the wake by packet functionality. The device should enter the D2 state after pressing power button. The device should wake by packet during the D2 state.

This test is not applicable to devices that support InstantGo.

Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Wireless LAN (802.11) Testing Prerequisites](wireless-lan--80211--testing-prerequisites.md).

This test performs the following actions:

-   Install custom protocol driver on Client machine to allow adding specific wake pattern and on AP machine to allow sending raw packets matching that pattern
-   Configure one router, as follows:
    -   Router 0 - 2.4Ghz : WPA2PSK/AES \[Preferred PHY G/Channel 6\]
    -   Router 0 - 5Ghz : WPA2PSK/AES \[Preferred PHY N/Channel 40\]
-   Perform a Scan and validate that the router is found
-   Validate that the adapter is reporting itself as AOAC capable and reports the NDIS\_PM\_WOL\_BITMAP\_PATTERN\_SUPPORTED capability
-   Create a profile for Router 0 - 2.4 GHz having ConnectionMode configured as manual.
-   Perform a WlanConnect using the profile
-   Check the wake up capabilities of the adapter and depending on support capabilities (in no specific order) execute WakePacket() test steps below for the following test wake patterns:
    -   A randomly created bitmap pattern
    -   An IPv4 TCP SYN pattern
    -   An IPv6 TCP SYN pattern
    -   An IPv4 wildcard destination address pattern
    -   An IPv6 wildcard destination address pattern

The WakePacket() Test case performs the following actions for a pattern specific test case

-   Configure the AP controller server machine to send the specified pattern packet after 2 minutes 30 seconds
-   Add the pattern to the WLAN adapter
-   Disable other Network Adapters on the Client machine
-   Start monitoring WLAN state and adapter power state events
-   Enter Connected Standby for 5 minutes
-   Enable other Network Adapters on the Client machine
-   Check the WLAN state and adapter power state events to validate that the adapter went to low power and woke up due to receipt of the pattern
