# Understanding the Windows ADK tools

The Windows Assessment Toolkit and the Windows Performance Toolkit compose the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK). Together, they provide a complete solution for evaluating overall computer performance and automating the deployment of the Windows operating system to new PCs.

This topic focuses on the Windows Assessment Toolkit. The assessment results are used to diagnose potential problems, so that the hardware and apps you develop are responsive and have a minimal impact on battery life, startup performance, and shutdown time. The same assessments are available for OEMs, ISVs, IHVs, enthusiasts, and other members of the community to establish a common framework to measure, compare, and review various aspects of quality.

Important business objectives can be achieved by using the Windows Assessment Toolkit:

<dl>
<dt><strong>Measure &amp; compare</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>You can use the data to compare components (apps, drivers, or both) against other similar components to facilitate your decision-making, recommendations, and competitive benchmarking.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Improve quality</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>You can work independently or involve partners to build a component (app, driver, or both) as per pre-defined quality criteria.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Track quality</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>You can create a process for efficiently tracking the quality of component versions and detect regressions after each iteration.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

The Assessment Toolkit is typically used in these scenarios:

<table>

<tr class="odd">
<td>&quot;Black box&quot;</td>
<td>Run a predefined job and examine the results for any unusual values or indications of issues with drivers, memory usage, or other areas that the assessments address.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Comparing results</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Run a single assessment using the recommended settings on any computer that’s running a supported operating system.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Windows AC to package the job to run on another computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the results to a share so that you can compare them.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the results from any computer running Windows with those of any other supported operating system to identify differences.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Clean computer</td>
<td>Run assessments on a clean computer that includes only the operating system to establish baseline system results.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Computer with added hardware or app components</td>
<td>Add new hardware or apps to the clean computer system and then re-run the assessments to compare the results with clean computer results.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Creating assessments</td>
<td>Use public APIs to develop or extend an assessment, or integrate assessments with your tools and infrastructure.</td>
