If you intend to open a support incident, follow these steps to obtain information useful to Customer Support Services:

1.  Please provide your submission .cpk package. This .cpk package should not just include Multi-Path I/O test t log but include logs for the SCSI Compliance test and the ALUA MPIO test.

2.  Please capture screenshots of your test environment. If the operating system is Windows 2008 R2 or later, please capture the MPIO configuration Snapshot screen from the Control Panel. To view this, click Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;MPIO&gt;Configuration Snapshot.

3.  If a crash happened, please create a dump file. Also rerun the following test in steps:

    1.  Copy the test binaries binaries and files to the Windows HLK test computer, which include: mpiotest.exe, mpioinstallfiltr.exe, iscsiui.exe, devcon.exe, pnpfiltr.sys, pnpdtest.exe and the mpiotest\_script\_fvt.txt file.

    2.  Open a command prompt window with Administrator privileges.

    3.  Run one of the following commands:

        -   If the bus type is iSCSI, then run the iscsui.exe tool and input information to create an iscsihctconfig.ini file.

        -   If the bus type is non-iSCSI, then run the command: mpioinstallfiltr -d &lt;DSM device instance path&gt; (for example ROOT\\MPIO\\0001) -i and then restart the test computer. If this command crashes, copy all the log files from the command console using Notepad.

    4.  Run the following command for test. Even if test crashes, you still can copy all log from command console to notepad.

        -   Mpiotest.exe -d &lt;DSM device instance path&gt; (for example ROOT\\MPIO\\0001) -s \[ScriptName\] -logo -isiSCSI \[T/F\].

    5.  If the bus type is non-iSCSI, then, from a command prompt, run the following command to uninstall the filter driver: mpioinstallfiltr -d &lt;DSM device instance path&gt;, (for example, ROOT\\MPIO\\0001) -c and restart the system boot machine.

## <span id="More_information"></span><span id="more_information"></span><span id="MORE_INFORMATION"></span>More information


This test is applied for Device Specific Modules (DSM) only, either Microsoft DSM or a third party DSM.

The test includes the following basic test assertions, which are combined into four test cases:

-   Failover: Data transfer is not broken when some paths are broken but not all.

-   Failback: Data transfer works normally when some paths are restored from failover.

-   Link bounce: For an MPIO environment, all paths except for one path are broken. If that path is broken and recovers within 15 seconds, the data transfer is able to continue without error.

-   Simultaneous failover and failback, or "simultaneous bouncing": Data transfer is not broken when some paths fail over and other paths fail back simultaneously.

-   Load balance policy: Different policy can be set and data transfer can work correctly with it. For Round Robin Load Policy and Round Robin Load Policy with subset, the test checks whether efficiency is degraded.

The test components include a stand-alone test application, a fault injection filter driver, a test case configuration file, an iSCSI configuration file (if the path is created over an iSCSI session), and the Device Test Manager (DTM).

Customers of an enterprise storage solution rely heavily on the high availability of its components. In storage, high availability is often implemented by redundancy. Multi-path I/O (MPIO) is one such implementation for the fabric layer of an enterprise storage solution. Microsoft supports multi-path I/O with a multi-path driver (mpio.sys) and a Device Specific Module (msdsm.sys) that ship with Windows Advanced Server operating system in the Windows Vista timeframe.

The test provides multi-path I/O testing for the compatibility of a vendor's storage solution with Microsoft driver solutions. It focuses on the following areas:

1.  Path failover and recovery should not affect data transfer quality. One purpose of setting up an MPIO environment is to increase the reliability of data transferring. This test simulates several simple scenarios that would happen in the real world to break a path, and then checks whether the environment can transfer data normally.

2.  Data transfer efficiency should be improved, or at least not degraded, in an MPIO environment.

3.  Storage devices should work normally under all policies they declare to support.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> For a Device Specific Module (DSM) that supports vendor policy (policy value is 7), please make the vendor's policy the current policy before running this test.



**To run this test**

1. The Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) starts the stand-alone test application, which retrieves the test cases to run.

2. The Windows HLK retrieves the MPIO test environment information for further testing.

3. If a path is not over iSCSI, the test loads the filter driver for a related HBA instance for further testing.

4. If the path is over iSCSI, provide the iSCSI configuration information using one of the following ways:

   - Input the configuration data into the window pop-up on the test client, which creates the Iscsihctconfig.ini file under \[WLK PATH\]\\JobsWorkingDir\\Tasks\\\[WTTJOBNAME\]\\. For more information, go to [iSCSI HBA Boot Test (LOGO)](ca7ad4d0-6950-4e2d-bdfe-b80c7873ba90.md).

     > [!NOTE]
     > 
     > If your test environment includes multiple targets, please choose to input one target related information, including IQN, portal IP and port number. For IP address, if you have several IP addresses, please input the one used to connect that target. Please for MPIO test, you do not need to input HBA PnP ID.
     > 
     > [!NOTE]
     > 
     > If your iSCSI environment support mutual chap, please check both Mutual radio box and Supports Mutual Chap check box.



~~~
-   The input iSCSI configuration information will be stored in the file of iscsihctconfig.ini. To save users time, we put a copy of this configuration file under \[WLKClient\]\\JobsWorkingDir\\ on test machine. Then users can rerun the test on same test client for same iSCSI storage target without inputting iSCSI configuration information again. Also, before testing, users can choose to create the Iscsihctconfig.ini file manually and put it under \[WLKClient\] \\JobsWorkingDir\\ on test machine, which contains the configuration data. Use the following format:

    ``` syntax
    [Targets] DiskTarget=Target [Target] TargetName=iqn.2001-05.com.equallogic:0-8a0906-7e2dd0401-fd1d03f67f74b96b-10-2411a0920-0 PortalPort=3260 PortalIPAddress=10.10.20.80 CHAPType=None
    ```
~~~

5.  Set the load balance policy, which declares support, simulates failover and failback scenarios, and performs testing. For a non-iSCSI test environment, simulate the link bouncing and simultaneous bouncing scenarios.

6.  Set the Round Robin policy for non-ALUA storage and ALUA storage to enable performance checking.

7.  The test tool logs to WTTLogger.
