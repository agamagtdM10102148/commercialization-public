This set of tests validates cameras functionality with the MF and IMFCaptureEngine.

- **Camera Driver Basic Tests - \\***

  Tests against a subset of camera media types and shorter duration of tests than functional or reliability.

- **Camera Driver Functional Tests - \\***

  Tests against a larger set of media types and have longer duration of the test.

- **Camera Driver Reliability Tests - \\***

  Tests against a larger set of media types and have longer duration of the test, and more complex scenarios.

- **\*- Multi Stream - \\***

  Validates that the system is able to take a photo, preview, and record.

This test will specifically set up a capture scenario that will preview and record simultaneously. It will user the preview pin to render an uncompressed mediatype and will use the record pin to save an H.264 video format and AAC audio format, and will also take a photo with JPEG as image format type.
