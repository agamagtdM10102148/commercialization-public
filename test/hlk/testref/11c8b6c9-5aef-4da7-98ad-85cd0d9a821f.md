This test is available when 'Systems' option of the HLK Selection UI is selected.

Unlike most HLK tests, this test will have to be run four times (back to back) for proper test coverage. Each time when the test is run it will indicate what iteration its on, for example when the test is run for the first time it will print 'Iteration 1 of 4' in the log file. On the final iteration the test will print a message such as 'Iteration 4 of 4'.

In each iteration system is either expected to be charged or discharged, the log window will indicate if the system is on charge cycle or discharge cycle. If the test is on a charge cycle it will display a message 'Waiting for system to go on AC', and when the test is on discharge cycle it will display 'Waiting for system to go on DC', please plug in the charger and unplug the charger respectively. Note that log window may not be visible on all systems.

Also at the end of each test iteration the test indicates if that iteration was successful with message 'Test iteration passed' message. If the test iteration fails 'Test iteration failed' message will be printed in the log, next time when the test is run it will re-run the last iteration.

These are the four iterations of the test:

(1) System is put on DC and discharged.

(2) System is put on AC and recharged.

(3) System is put on DC and discharged.

(4) System is put on AC and recharged.

>[!NOTE]
>  If it is desired to re-start the test iteration, please run the 'Battery Validation - Drain Test Reset' test (only once), after that this test will commence from iteration one again.)
