This automated test toggles the radio states in the same way as the user interface airplane mode option.

>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft will be accepting 802.11ad WDI drivers for HLK certification for the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709) to facilitate broad distribution and testing among Windows Insiders and ecosystem partners. However, due to the lack of broad testing of 802.11ad WDI functionality, this feature is enabled as a developer preview for the Windows 10, version 1709 release. 
>
>If a problem is encountered with 802.11ad functionality, please contact your 802.11ad IHV partner for support assistance.   Microsoft is committed to supporting 802.11ad Wi-Fi connectivity in a future version of Windows 10 in order to enable wireless docking and other scenarios.

Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Wireless LAN (802.11) Testing Prerequisites](wireless-lan--80211--testing-prerequisites.md).

The test completes the following:

-   Disables each radio that is reported to the operating system..

-   Each radio must change state and report its updated state in less than ten seconds.

-   Enables each radio that is reported to the operating system.

-   Each radio must change state and report its update state in under ten seconds

The test allows for and can accommodate devices that change the state of all radios when only one radio is requested.

The test will only fail if an exception is thrown when attempting any of the above tasks, or if radios do not change state within the time required.
