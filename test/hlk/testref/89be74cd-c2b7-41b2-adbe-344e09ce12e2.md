This test suite validates that the WLAN adapter is able to send and receive IPv4/IPv6 and UDP/TCP unicast, broadcast, and multicast packets.

Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Wireless LAN (802.11) Testing Prerequisites](wireless-lan--80211--testing-prerequisites.md).

This test performs the following actions:

-   Configure one router (Router 0), as follows:
    -   Router 0 - 2.4Ghz : WPA2PSK/AES \[Prefered PHY N\]
    -   Router 0 - 5Ghz : WPA2PSK/AES \[Prefered PHY N\]
-   Execute the DataExchange() test steps below for Router 0 - 2.4 GHz
-   If adapter supports 5GHz, execute the DataExchange() test steps below for Router 0 - 5 GHz

The DataExchange() test performs the following actions:

-   Create a profile for the appropriate band having ConnectionMode configured as manual.
-   On Client machine perform a WlanConnect using the profile
-   Wait for the adapter to obtain an IP address
-   On Support machine perform a WlanConnect using the profile
-   Wait for the adapter to obtain an IP address
-   Launch parallel threads that perform the data send and receive between the Client and Support machine (through the AP). The test log prints the IP address and port number used for each exchange. Between each send call there is a 1 to 3 second sleep. The packet sizes are randomly determined. The following packet exchanges are performed:

    -   UDP Send (IPv4) from Client to Support
    -   UDP Receive (IPv4) from Support to Client
    -   UDP Send (IPv6) from Client to Support
    -   UDP Receive (IPv6) from Support to Client
    -   TCP Send (IPv4) from Client to Support
    -   TCP Receive (IPv4) from Support to Client
    -   TCP Send (IPv6) from Client to Support
    -   TCP Receive (IPv6) from Support to Client
    -   Multicast Send (IPv4) from Client to Support
    -   Multicast Receive (IPv4) from Support to Client
    -   Multicast Send (IPv6) from Client to Support
    -   Multicast Receive (IPv6) from Support to Client
    -   Broadcast Send (IPv4) from Client to Support
    -   Broadcast Receive (IPv4) from Support to Client

-   Stop the data traffic after 2 minutes
-   Validate that the percentage of packets received to the packet sent is within an acceptable percentage.
    -   For TCP traffic 95% of the packets sent should be received
    -   For all other traffic, 80% of the packets sent should be received
