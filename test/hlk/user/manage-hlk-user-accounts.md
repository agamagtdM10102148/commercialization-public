# Manage HLK User Accounts


An HLK user account is automatically created for the person who installed the HLK Controller, and that account is granted administrator privileges within HLK. A person who has a HLK user account with administrator privileges is called a HLK administrator.

HLK administrators can create new HLK user accounts or modify the permissions of existing HLK user accounts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> To create an HLK user account for a domain user, as opposed to a user account for a local user, you must be logged on to the HLK Studio computer as a domain user with administrator rights on the local machine.

 

If you try to create an HLK user account for a domain user while you are logged on as a local user with administrator rights, an error message will appear informing you that the user for whom you are trying to set up permissions does not exist in the domain. The domain referred to in the error message is the local machine and not the domain to which it is connected.

When you create a new user account for an HLK user, you must also assign a datastore role for the user.

The following is a list of the HLK datastore roles that you can assign a user when you create the new user account.

<th>Role</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>hlk_DSGuests</p></td>
<td><p>With a guest user account, you can log in without having a user account to access the HLK datastore. This level of access is very restricted and only allows the user to view the results of a job.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>hlk_DSUsers</p></td>
<td><p>To obtain access to a Microsoft SQL Server database, you must have a corresponding user account for that database.</p>
<p>This user account allows the HLK user to perform several of the basic tasks associated with logo testing. See the permissions table that follows for more details</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>hlk_DSAdministrators</p></td>
<td><p>If a user is assigned this role, that user has administrator privileges on the local system and is able to install a system. Additionally, if the host computer is part of a Windows domain, the Administrator account usually has domain-wide privileges as well.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>hlk_DSOwners</p></td>
<td><p>The datastore owner is a user that has permission to perform all activities in the database. See the permissions table that follows for more details.</p>
<p>To the HLK Studio user interface, the HLK_DSOwners and the HLK_DSAdministrators roles are the same. However, the level of access a user has to the HLK datastore itself when he or she is assigned the HLK_DSOwners role far surpasses the level of access a HLK_DSAdministrators user has. As such, you must only assign the HLK_DSOwners role to users who are very knowledgeable about Microsoft SQL Server.</p></td>

      > 
      > If you are creating multiple user accounts, separate each user with a semicolon.
