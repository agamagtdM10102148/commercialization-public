## More Information
### Parameters

| Parameter Name | Parameter Description |
| --- | --- |
| **WaitTimeMultiplier** | For tests that require the Type-C MUTT, this is a multiplier of the generic wait times that the test will wait for the Type-C MUTT to be enumerated. In general, the default times should be sufficient, but some platforms require additional time. |
| **SupportedCAMChangeNotification** | Set to False if the SUT cannot trigger the Supported CAM Change notification. |
| **WaitTimeInMinutes** | For tests that require manual intervention, this is the amount of time in minutes the test will wait to see the event that is expected to occur in response to the requested manual action. |
| **UcsiConnectorNumber** | UCSI connector that the Type-C MUTT device is connected to. |
