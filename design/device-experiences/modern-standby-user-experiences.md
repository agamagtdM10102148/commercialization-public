# Modern standby user experiences


Modern standby is more than just a low-power sleep state—it is part of many Windows 10 fundamental user experiences. When the screen is off, the modern standby state is presented to the user as the system "sleep" state.

The following topics describe the modern standby user experience.

<td><p>The largest benefit to the modern standby user experience is the instant resume when the system is turned on. Because Wi-Fi is always on during modern standby, turning on the system allows the user to immediately get to work—with fast turn-on, Wi-Fi already connected, and email already synced.</p></td>

<td><p>Notifications during modern standby and their auditory alerts can be disturbing to some users, particularly in the evening and late night hours. The Quiet Hours feature suppresses notifications and helps save battery power. Quiet Hours allows the user to define a period of time each day during which notifications and background tasks are suppressed.</p></td>
