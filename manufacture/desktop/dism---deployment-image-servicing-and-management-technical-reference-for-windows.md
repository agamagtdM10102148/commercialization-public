# DISM - Deployment Image Servicing and Management


Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is a command-line tool that is used to mount and service Windows images before deployment. You can use DISM image management commands to mount and get information about Windows image (.wim) files or virtual hard disks (VHD). You can also use DISM to capture, split, and otherwise manage .wim files.

You can use DISM to install, uninstall, configure, and update Windows features, packages, drivers, and international settings in a .wim file or VHD using the DISM servicing commands.

DISM commands are used on offline images, but subsets of the DISM commands are also available for servicing a running operating system.

DISM is installed with Windows, and it is also distributed in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (WindowsÂ ADK). DISM replaces several deployment tools, including PEimg, Intlcfg, ImageX, and Package Manager.
