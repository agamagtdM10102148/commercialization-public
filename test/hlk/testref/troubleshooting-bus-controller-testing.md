# Troubleshooting Bus Controller Testing


To troubleshoot bus controller test issues, follow these steps:

1. Review the following Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) topics:

   - [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md)

   - One of the following topics, depending on the type of bus controller that you are testing:

     -   [Bluetooth Controller Testing Prerequisites](bluetooth-controller-testing-prerequisites.md)

     -   [Proximity Controller Testing Prerequisites](proximity-controller-testing-prerequisites.md)

     -   [Secure Digital Host Controller Testing Prerequisites](secure-digital-host-controller-testing-prerequisites.md)

     -   [USB Bus Controller Testing Prerequisites](usb-bus-controller-testing-prerequisites.md)

     -   [WITT I2C Testing Prerequisites](witt-i2c-testing-prerequisites.md)

2. Verify that you have installed the latest Windows HLK filters and kit updates. For more information, see [Windows Hardware Lab Kit Filters](../user/windows-hardware-lab-kit-filters.md).

3. For a test failure, look for usable information in the Windows HLK Studio test log. If you find usable information, resolve the issue and rerun the test.

4. If you cannot obtain a successful test result, contact [Windows HLK Support](../user/windows-hlk-support.md).

The following table describes common issues that can occur during Bluetooth controller testing:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Issue</th>
<th>Resolution</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Failures finding Bluetooth devices during an Bluetooth Inquiry command</p></td>
<td><p>This failure can happen when you run a test in a noisy environment. Rerunning the test usually fixes this error. You can also try to bring the radios closer together. Make sure that the radios have a clear line of sight. Turn off other radios that may be causing interference.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Failures connecting Bluetooth devices during Bluetooth Inquiry commands</p></td>
<td><p>This failure occurs when the test times out before the devices could be reconnected. Rerunning the test usually fixes this error.</p></td>

The following table describes common issues that can occur during Windows Inter-Integrated Circuit (I<sup>2</sup>C) Testing Tool (WITT) controller testing:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Issue</th>
<th>Resolution</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>All tests failed with error message <strong>WITT device test interface is not found</strong>.</p></td>
<td><p>Review <a href="witt-i2c-testing-prerequisites.md" data-raw-source="[WITT I2C Testing Prerequisites](witt-i2c-testing-prerequisites.md)">WITT I2C Testing Prerequisites</a>. Make sure that the WITT test peripheral driver is installed, ACPI table modified with sample ASL and four instances of WITT Test Driver are found in Windows HLK Device Manager.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>WITT firmware needs to be updated. The WITT firmware binary (i2c9665a.iic) is released as part of. When you install a new Windows HLK package, you should update the WITT firmware.</p></td>
<td><p>See <a href="witt-i2c-testing-prerequisites.md" data-raw-source="[WITT I2C Testing Prerequisites](witt-i2c-testing-prerequisites.md)">WITT I2C Testing Prerequisites</a> for instructions on how to upgrade the WITT firmware.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>WITT device is in a bad state. Typically, the green LED on a WITT device should be lit when there is no traffic, and should blink when there is traffic. Otherwise, the WITT or I<sup>2</sup>C controller might be in a bad state.</p></td>
<td><p>Unplug the WITTs USB cable to power-cycle the device. If the controller is still not working, reboot the testing system.</p></td>
