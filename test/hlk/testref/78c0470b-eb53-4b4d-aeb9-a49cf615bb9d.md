# Manual Test - Crash Dump Creation

This is a manual test & it should be run outside HLK by following the manual instructions provided below.
                                            If this test is run as an automated test from HLK studio/controller, the test will pass by default without testing any functionality.
                                            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            Manual instructions to run this test:
                                            I.  Hardware Prerequisites
                                                1.  Device under test
                                            II. Software Prerequisites
                                                1.  Firmware & full OS
                                            III.    Setting up the Test
                                                1.  On device under test, flash firmware & install full OS
                                            IV. Running the Test
                                                1.  Power up the device with a KD session
                                                2.  Break into the debugger manually
                                                3.  Run .crash command from debugger to trigger a kernel mode crash
                                                4.  System will crash & reboot
                                                5.  Open this file: %SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP in windbg
                                                6.  Verify that the memory.dmp file is valid and shows crash data for: 
                                                        MANUALLY_INITIATED_CRASH (e2)
                                                        The user manually initiated this crash dump.
                                            V.  Verification
                                                1.  Verify that a full memory dump file gets generated for kernel mode crashes
                                            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            Note: This test is associated with an optional feature: System.Client.ARM64DesktopHardware. It will not appear in the list of tests in HLK studio for a system target by default.
                                            Optional: To enable it to show up in the list of tests for system target in HLK studio, run the following steps:
                                            1] In HLK Studio, select system target
                                            2] Right click on the selected system target
                                            3] Click on Add\Modify Features
                                            4] A Device Feature List window will open up
                                            5] Scroll down to select the feature named: System.Client.MobileHardware 
                                            6] Click on the check box to enable this optional feature
                                            7] This test will now appear in the list of applicable tests for the selected system target in HLK studio
