As with the removal test, the test application attempts to add an upper filter to the target device stack and then restart the device stack by using **SetupDiCallClassInstaller** with DIF\_PROPERTYCHANGE. If this attempt is not successful (that is, if someone on the target device stack failed the query-remove IRP), the test restarts the computer to test rebalance.

This test initiates a rebalance but when the filter driver gets the start after the rebalance, it deliberately fails it-which causes the surprise removal IRP followed by Removal IRP.

First, it starts the rebalance procedure and makes sure that the driver gets a stop and a start by generating fake resource requirement for a device which does not consume any resources.

-   IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_STOP\_DEVICE (assuming this IRP is passed by all the drivers. The test already covered the case where this IRP is failed.)
-   IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_RESOURCE\_REQUIREMENTS
-   IRP\_MN\_FILTER\_RESOURCE\_REQUIREMENTS (If the actual resource requirement are null, filter assign fake resource requirement, so there is a stop and a start.)
-   IRP\_MN\_STOP\_DEVICE
-   IRP\_MN\_START\_DEVICE (The filter fails this IRP while going up. This action causes the surprise remove IRP.)
-   IRP\_MN\_SURPRISE\_REMOVAL
-   IRP\_MN\_REMOVE

After the rebalance test is complete, the device will be uninstalled and reenumerated, also removing the filter driver from the stack.

-   **Test binary:** Devfund\_PnPDTest.dll
-   **Test method:** PNPTryStopDeviceAndFailRestart

The Disable Enhanced Device Testing (EDT) Support test uninstalls the test filter driver (msdmfilt.sys) as an upper filter on devices specified using the DQ parameter. This test filter gets installed as part of running tests in this test category

-   **Test binary:** Devfund\_PnPDTest.dll
-   **Test method:** DisableEnhancedDeviceTestingSupport
