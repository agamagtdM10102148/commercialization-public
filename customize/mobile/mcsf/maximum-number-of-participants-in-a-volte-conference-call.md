# Maximum number of participants in a VoLTE conference call


OEMs can specify the maximum number of participants or callers that can be added to a voice over LTE (VoLTE) conference call based on the mobile operator's network requirements.

By default, WindowsÂ 10 Mobile supports up to 6-way conference (host + 5 participants) for VoLTE conference calls.
