Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Mouse or other Pointing Device Testing Prerequisites](mouse-or-other-pointing-device-testing-prerequisites.md).

The test presents two iterations, during which you are prompted to refrain from touching the touchpad for 60 seconds. If the system has an external power source, it should be unplugged for the second iteration.

In each case, the test validates that no contacts are registered on the touchpad as expected.
