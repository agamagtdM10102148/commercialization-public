There are a number of checks done:

-   The Machine of the targets are in the same machine pool.

-   The Machine of the targets have the same OS Platform.

-   Both targets are the same target type.

-   Both targets have common manufacturer/VID/Ven.

-   Both targets have common driver hash (of all drivers associated with this device, including any upper and lower filters).

-   Both targets have a common INF hash.

-   Both targets have the same bus/enumerator type.

-   Both targets have the same class/subclass.

-   If DX capable, same DX major version.

-   All targets are on unique machines.

If any of the checks fail, the method returns false.
