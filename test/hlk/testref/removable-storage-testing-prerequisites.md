# Removable Storage Testing Prerequisites


This topic describes the tasks that you must complete before you test a removable storage device by using the Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK):

-   [Hardware Requirements](#bkmk-hardwarerequirements).

-   [Software Requirements](#bkmk-softwarerequirements).

-   [Configuring the Test Computer](#bkmk-configure).

## <span id="BKMK_HardwareRequirements"></span><span id="bkmk-hardwarerequirements"></span><span id="BKMK_HARDWAREREQUIREMENTS"></span>Hardware Requirements


To test a removable storage device, you need the following hardware. You might need additional hardware if the test device offers other features. To determine whether additional hardware requirements apply, see the description for each test that appears for the device in Windows HLK Studio.

- 1 test computer that meets the Windows HLK requirements. In addition, this computer must include:

  - Logo-compliant Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) BIOS, with ACPI enabled by default.

  - 1 host controller that has the appropriate bus interface for the test device.

    > [!NOTE]
    > 
    > If the host controller isn't bootable, you also need 1 bootable bus controller (for example, a SCSI controller). If the host controller is bootable, you don't need an additional controller.

         

- The removable storage device that you want to test.

- 1 hard disk drive of the same bus type as the bootable controller for the test system, with at least 36 gigabytes (GB) of space.

- 1 cable to connect the test device to the host controller.

- 2 blank pieces of media, or the appropriate type for the test device, that are prepared for use.

- If the device is connected through USB, 1 USB 2.0 high-speed hub.

To certify your product for use on servers, the test computer must support four processors and a minimum of 1 GB of RAM. These system capabilities are required to test the Rebalance, D3 State, and Multiple Processor Group functionality of the device and driver. You do not need a computer that actually has more than 64 processors to test your device. Additionally, the server system(s) being used for device or driver testing must have Server Core installed prior to testing. For more information see [Windows Server Installation Options](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=251454).

If you use a pool of test computers to test your device, at least 1 computer in the pool must contain 4 processors and a minimum of 1 GB of RAM. Additionally, that computer must contain the device and the driver that you want to test. As long as the driver is the same on all the computers in the pool, the system creates a schedule to run against all test computers.

For tests that don't include a driver to test, like tests for a hard disk drive, the Windows HLK scheduler constrains the tests that validate the device's and driver's Rebalance, D3 State, and Multiple Processor Groups functionality to run on the default test computer. You must manually configure this computer to have multiple processor groups. The default computer is the first test computer in the list. Make sure that the first test computer in the list meets the minimum hardware requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Except for para-virtualization drivers (as defined by the [WHCP Policies and Processes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=615222) document), you can't use any form of virtualization when you test physical devices and their associated drivers for server certification or signature. Virtualization products don't support the underlying functionality that's required to pass the tests that relate to multiple processor groups, device power management, device Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) functionality, and other tests.
> 
> [!NOTE]
>  Multiple Processor Groups Setting
> You must set the value for the processor group size for Hardware Lab Kit testing of Windows Server 2008 R2 and later device drivers for certification. This is done by running bcdedit in an elevated command prompt window, using the /set option.
> 
> The commands for adding the group settings and restarting are as follows:
> 
> ``` syntax
> bcdedit.exe /set groupsize 2
> bcdedit.exe /set groupaware on
> shutdown.exe -r -t 0 -f
> ```
> 
> 
> The commands for removing the group settings and rebooting are as follows:
> 
> ``` syntax
> bcdedit.exe /deletevalue groupsize
> bcdedit.exe /deletevalue groupaware
> shutdown.exe -r -t 0 -f
> ```
> 
> 
> [!NOTE]
> 
> **Code Integrity Setting**
> 
> The Virtualization Based Security feature (VBS) of Windows Server 2016 must be enabled using Server Manager first.
> 
> Once that has occurred, the following Registry key must be created and set:
> 
> ``` syntax
> HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard
> HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity:REG_DWORD
> 0 or 1 (disabled, enabled)
> ```

 

## <span id="BKMK_SoftwareRequirements"></span><span id="bkmk-softwarerequirements"></span><span id="BKMK_SOFTWAREREQUIREMENTS"></span>Software Requirements


To test a removable storage device, you need this software:

-   The drivers for the test device

-   The latest Windows HLK filters or updates

## <span id="BKMK_Configure"></span><span id="bkmk-configure"></span><span id="BKMK_CONFIGURE"></span>Configuring the Test Computer


To configure the test computer for your test device, follow these steps:

1. Install the appropriate Windows operating system on the test computer, and then configure the computer for your test network. The test network is the network that contains Windows HLK Studio and Windows HLK Controller.

2. Install the test device and any accessories.

3. If you must install the manufacturer-supplied device driver on the test computer, do this now.

4. If the test device is connected through a USB port, connect the USB 2.0 controller to the high-speed USB 2.0 hub, and then connect the test device to the downstream port of the high-speed USB 2.0 hub.

   > [!NOTE]
   > 
   > Don't connect the USB test device directly to the root hub of the USB 2.0 controller.

     

5. Place media in every port of the test device.

6. Verify that the removable storage device functions correctly on the test computer.

7. Install the Windows HLK client application on the test computer.

8. Use Windows HLK Studio to create a computer pool, and then move the test computer to that pool.

Make sure that the test computer is in the ready state before you begin your testing. If a test requires you to set parameters before you run it, a dialog box will appear for that test. For more information, review the specific test topic.

Some Windows HLK tests require user intervention. When you're running tests for a submission, it's a best practice to run the automated tests in a block separately from manual tests. This prevents a manual test from interrupting the completion of an automated test.

> [!WARNING]
> 
> When testing storage devices, we strongly recommend that you complete all Device Fundamentals tests before starting storage tests. Storage tests will reconfigure your test device, leaving the device in a state unsuitable to support Device Fundamentals tests. The following configurations provide steps to create volume on the storage test device. This is important to complete the Device Fundamental part of testing (DevFund).
