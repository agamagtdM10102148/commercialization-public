# PackageWriter.AddDriver Method

This method replaces a driver for an Update Package and checks the driver files for driver signability. The signability tests are done when drivers are added to the package. If the signability tests fail the driver is not added to the package. Down level OS signability tests are automatically run. Errors from these signability results will not prevent submission creation (will not cause a false return value). The error messages for down level operating system signability runs will be captured and returned as warnings.

**Namespace:** Microsoft.Windows.Kits.Hardware.ObjectModel.Submission

**Assembly:** Microsoft.Windows.Kits.Hardware.ObjectModel.Submission (in Microsoft.Windows.Kits.Hardware.ObjectModel.Submission)

*targets*

     The set of supported test targets for this driver.

*locales*

     The set of supported locales for this driver.

*errorMessages*

     A reference to a string collection that contains all the error messages for the submission package.

*warningMessages*

An exception is thrown when:

-   The *pathToDriver* paramter, the *targets* parameter or the *locales* parameter is **null**.

-   The *pathToDrivers* parameter is empty or there are no *targets* or *locales* values in the parameter lists or the *targets* specified do not exist in the project.
