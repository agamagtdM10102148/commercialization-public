# Display, sleep, and hibernate idle timers


A system that can enter the traditional ACPI Sleep (S3) state implements both a display idle time-out and a sleep idle time-out. The reason for providing two separate time-outs is to allow the system to stay turned on and fully running, but save power by turning off the display. In contrast, a connected standby PC has a single, unified display-off and sleep idle time-out that is simply called the "sleep" time-out. This power model is similar to that used by most smartphones: when the screen is off, the system is always in a low-power mode and always connected to the Internet.

In a connected standby PC, the display idle time-out is not displayed in the Power Options control panel or in the PC Settings app. A mobile system that has the traditional ACPI Sleep (S3) state also supports the ACPI Hibernate (S4) state. Hibernate is used to reduce battery drain during sleep by saving all information in memory to the disk and powering off the system completely. In contrast, a connected standby PC does not idle to the Hibernate (S4) state to save power. That's because connected standby is a consistently low-power state with long battery life. A connected standby PC is similar to a smartphone—few users would tolerate their smartphone periodically turning off and entering hibernation. Instead, users would expect the system to stay turned on and connected but operate in a low-power mode.

The following table summarizes the differences between a connected standby PC and a PC that supports the ACPI S3 and S4 states.
