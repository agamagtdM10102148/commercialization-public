|:--------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Additional lock screen backgrounds](additional-lock-screen-backgrounds.md)| OEMs can add new lock screen background images for the lock screen and also set the default lock screen background. |
| [Brightness tuning](brightness-tuning.md) | When the **Brightness** screen in **Settings** is not set to automatically adjust, this customization enables the user to select low, medium, and high intensities for the screen brightness. |
| [Default theme and accent color for Kid's Corner](kids-corner-default-theme-and-accent-color.md)             | Partners can set the default theme, including the background color (light or dark) and the accent color for Kidâ€™s Corner.   |
| [Enable dark mode](start-theme-settings-enabling-dark-mode.md) | OEMs can choose to specify whether the dark mode is applied.     |
| [Hide the auto brightness setting](hide-the-auto-brightness-setting.md)   | OEMs can hide the automatic brightness setting for phones that do not have an ambient light sensor.   |
| [Lock screen notifications](lock-screen-notifications.md) | OEMs can preload apps that support lock screen notifications.     |
| [Lock screen timeout for AMOLED and OLED displays](screen-time-out-for-amoled-and-oled-displays.md)   | OEMs can remove the 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and Never options from the Screen times out after dropdown in the Lock screen settings screen.    |
| [Warning about light theme for AMOLED and OLED screens](warning-about-light-theme-for-amoled-and-oled-screens.md) | OEMs can choose to display a warning about battery life if the user selects the light theme on phones with AMOLED or OLED displays. This customization is not relevant for other screen types, as there is not a significant power difference between the themes with the light and dark background.  |
