## <span id="Usage"></span><span id="usage"></span><span id="USAGE"></span>Usage


**Visual Basic**

`Dim instance As Test`

`Dim logicalMachineSet As MachineSet`

`Dim returnValue As IList(Of TestResult)`

`returnValue = instance.QueueTest(logicalMachineSet)`

## <span id="Syntax"></span><span id="syntax"></span><span id="SYNTAX"></span>Syntax


**Visual Basic**

`Public Overridable Function QueueTest ( _`

          `logicalMachineSet As MachineSet _`

`) As IList(Of TestResult)`

**C#**

`public virtual IList<TestResult> QueueTest (`

          `MachineSet logicalMachineSet`

`) `

*logicalMachineSet*

     A list of machines to run this on.

## <span id="Return_Value"></span><span id="return_value"></span><span id="RETURN_VALUE"></span>Return Value


Returns IList, a list of results for the jobs that were scheduled. The test computer is always part of the machine set, this is only for additional test computers, required in multi-machine tests.

> [!TIP]
> 
> If you use the **QueueTest** method to add a computer to a test queue and that computer configuration subsequently changes, **QueueTest** can throw an exception. If an exception occurs, immediately retry **QueueTest**.

 

## <span id="Remarks"></span><span id="remarks"></span><span id="REMARKS"></span>Remarks


The machine associated with the selected target is automatically added to the set.

QueueTest attempts to schedule the current test. If there is a failure, the scheduling of tests is stopped immediately and an exception is thrown. As a result, some tests might still be scheduled.

This is not supported when the project is connected to a package.

## <span id="Thread_Safety"></span><span id="thread_safety"></span><span id="THREAD_SAFETY"></span>Thread Safety


Any public static (**Shared** in Visual Basic) members of this type are thread safe. Any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe.
