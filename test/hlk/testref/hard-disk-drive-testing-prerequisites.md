# Hard Disk Drive Testing Prerequisites


This topic describes the tasks that you must complete before you test a hard disk by using the Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK):

-   [Hardware Requirements](#bkmk-hardwarerequirements).

-   [Software Requirements](#bkmk-softwarerequirements).

-   [Configuring the Test Computer](#bkmk-configure).

The tests that you must run depend on the capabilities of the hard disk that you want to test, its connection type (for example, an external USB-based hard drive), or how it's configured (as part of a RAID system or part of an IP-based storage solution).

The Windows HLK supports the testing of hard disks that have these connection types:

-   Fibre Channel

-   IEEE 1394

-   Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA)

-   PC Card

-   Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)

-   Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA)

-   SCSI

-   USB

-   SD / EMMC

## <span id="BKMK_HardwareRequirements"></span><span id="bkmk-hardwarerequirements"></span><span id="BKMK_HARDWAREREQUIREMENTS"></span>Hardware Requirements


The hardware that's required for testing a hard drive varies depending on the connection type. But, all tests for hard disks require 1 test computer. The test computer must meet the Windows HLK requirements. For more information, see [Windows HLK Prerequisites](../getstarted/windows-hlk-prerequisites.md).

> [!NOTE]
> 
> You might need additional hardware if the hard drive is part of a storage system. To determine whether additional hardware requirements apply, see the test description for each test that appears for the device in Windows HLK Studio.



To certify your product for use on servers, the test computer must support four processors and a minimum of 1 GB of RAM. These system capabilities are required to test the Rebalance, D3 State, and Multiple Processor Group functionality of the device and driver. You do not need a computer that actually has more than 64 processors to test your device. Additionally, the server system(s) being used for device or driver testing must have Server Core installed prior to testing. For more information see [Windows Server Installation Options](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=251454).

If you use a pool of test computers to test your device, at least 1 computer in the pool must contain 4 processors and a minimum of 1 GB of RAM. Additionally, that computer must contain the device and the driver that you want to test. As long as the driver is the same on all the computers in the pool, the system creates a schedule to run against all test computers.

For tests that don't include a driver, like tests for a hard disk drive, the Windows HLK scheduler constrains the tests that validate the device's and driver's Rebalance, D3 State, and Multiple Processor Groups functionality to run on the default test computer. You must manually configure this computer to have multiple processor groups. The default computer is the first test computer in the list. Make sure that the first test computer in the list meets the minimum hardware requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Except for para-virtualization drivers (as defined by the [WHCP Policies and Processes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=615222) document), you can't use any form of virtualization when you test physical devices and their associated drivers for server certification or signature. Virtualization products don't support the underlying functionality that's required to pass the tests that relate to multiple processor groups, device power management, device PCI functionality, and other tests.
> 
> [!NOTE]
>  Multiple Processor Groups Setting
> You must set the value for the processor group size for Hardware Lab Kit testing of Windows Server 2008 R2 and later device drivers for certification. This is done by running bcdedit in an elevated command prompt window, using the /set option.
> 
> The commands for adding the group settings and restarting are as follows:
> 
> ``` syntax
> bcdedit.exe /set groupsize 2
> bcdedit.exe /set groupaware on
> shutdown.exe -r -t 0 -f
> ```
> 
> 
> The commands for removing the group settings and rebooting are as follows:
> 
> ``` syntax
> bcdedit.exe /deletevalue groupsize
> bcdedit.exe /deletevalue groupaware
> shutdown.exe -r -t 0 -f
> ```
> 
> 
> [!NOTE]
> 
> **Code Integrity Setting**
> 
> The Virtualization Based Security feature (VBS) of Windows Server 2016 must be enabled using Server Manager first.
> 
> Once that has occurred, the following Registry key must be created and set:
> 
> ``` syntax
> HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard
> HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity:REG_DWORD
> 0 or 1 (disabled, enabled)
> ```

## <span id="BKMK_SoftwareRequirements"></span><span id="bkmk-softwarerequirements"></span><span id="BKMK_SOFTWAREREQUIREMENTS"></span>Software Requirements


To test a hard disk, you need this software:

-   The drivers for the hard disk controllers, if required

-   The latest Windows HLK filters or updates

## <span id="BKMK_Configure"></span><span id="bkmk-configure"></span><span id="BKMK_CONFIGURE"></span>Configuring the Test Computer


Before you begin testing the hard disk, you must configure the test computer and install the appropriate controller (if the test computer doesn't include this kind of controller). Then, you must complete the appropriate configuration steps, based on the type of hard disk that you're certifying.

Make sure that the test computer is in the ready state before you begin your testing. If a test requires you to set parameters before you run it, a dialog box will appear for that test. For more information, review the specific test topic.

Some Windows HLK tests require user intervention. When you're running tests for a submission, it's a best practice to run the automated tests in a block separately from manual tests. This prevents a manual test from interrupting the completion of an automated test.

> [!WARNING]
> 
> When testing storage devices, we strongly recommend that you complete all Device Fundamentals tests before starting storage tests. Storage tests will reconfigure your test device, leaving the device in a state unsuitable to support Device Fundamentals tests. The following configurations provide steps to create volume on the storage test device. This is important to complete the Device Fundamental part of testing (DevFund).



**To configure the test computer to test your Fibre Channel hard disk**

1.  Install the appropriate Windows operating system on the test computer, and then configure the computer for your test network. The test network is the network that contains Windows HLK Studio and Windows HLK Controller.

2.  If the test system doesn't have a SCSI adapter installed, install the SCSI adapter.

3.  Install 2 identical SCSI hard disk drives and 1 CD-ROM drive onto the SCSI bus.
