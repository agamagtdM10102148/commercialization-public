# Performance â€“ Windows 10 Engineering Guide

As we look to the next generation of technology, customers continue to expect high-performing and power-efficient PCs and demand that today's PCs provide the richness of a modern web experience, long battery life, and a diverse portfolio of powerful software. Customers expect new devices to provide the always-on and always-connected experiences that they have with their mobile phones and that can only be enabled in a connected-standby PC.

The Performance Windows Engineering Guide (WEG) provides guidance on how to deliver a great Windows experience on a high-performing PC. It identifies opportunities to measure, analyze, and improve performance in key areas, including battery life, web browsing, and streaming media. OEM, ODM, and IHV partners can also find guidance on developing and selecting Microsoft Store apps that run efficiently on your systems.

The WEG provides tools and guidance to make full use of Windows features for hardware, mechanical, firmware, software, and manufacturing engineers and does not address business and marketing audiences. Topics include how to optimize for performance while following manufacturing best practices and while developing and deploying drivers, apps, firmware, and hardware. This guidance applies to traditional x86-based PCs as well as devices that offer connected standby and applies to both the consumer and commercial markets.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Performance WEG is not intended to communicate the Windows Hardware Compatibility Requirements (WHCR) and OEM Policy Document (OPD). Both WHCR and OPD take precedence over any information in the Performance WEG. You must comply with the WHCR and OPD.
