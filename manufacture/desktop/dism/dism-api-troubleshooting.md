# DISM API Troubleshooting


The Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) API allows you to build customized solutions on the DISM platform. You can troubleshoot your solution in development by reviewing the errors and warnings in the DISM API log file. You can change the location and the level of information you want to receive for the log file during your call to the [DismInitialize Function](disminitialize-function.md).

For more information about best practices when coding with the DISMAPI, see [Using the DISM API](using-the-dism-api.md).

Standard Windows errors may also be reported during a DISMAPI process. You can obtain more information about any listed Win32Â® system error codes by typing `net helpmsg` on the command line and, then typing the error code number.
