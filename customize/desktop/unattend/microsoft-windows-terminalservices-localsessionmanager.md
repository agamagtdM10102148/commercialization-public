# Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager

The Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager component is responsible for starting the computer and implementing Windows Fast User Switching (FUS). FUS utilizes the data separation technology of user profiles, providing a fast and convenient mechanism for switching between user accounts.

Terminal Services uses terminal emulation to deliver the Windows desktop and Windows-based applications to a wide variety of computers.
