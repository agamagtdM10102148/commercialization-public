This automated test iterates through some of the core Winsock functionality against a loopback interface and verifies whether the Winsock API interface is correctly maintained.

All tests cover IPv4 and IPv6 sockets, which all bind to the loopback interface. Variations are as follows:

-   **Socket Catalog.** Enumerates the Winsock catalog, creates a socket for each returned **protocolinfo** structure (each protocol tuple), and binds it to the loopback interface.

-   **OVERLAPPED IO.** Creates both IPv4 and IPv6 TCP stream sockets, establishes a connection over loopback, and sends data between sockets via blocking send and overlapped receive calls. All data is verified as received.

-   **TransmitFile variation.** Verifies that **TransmitFile** correctly sends data and implements the **TF\_DISCONNECT** flag for socket reuse for both IPv4 and IPv6 sockets. Creates a 260-byte temporary file and transmits over a TCP connection via **TransmitFile**. The listening socket uses **AcceptEx** to verify the connection and socket reuse.

-   **ConditionalAccept.** Verifies semantics of conditional accept over both IPv4 and IPv6 TCP stream sockets. Tests five connections: without a listener, returning **CF\_REJECT**, returning **CF\_ACCEPT**, returning **CF\_DEFER + CF\_REJECT**, and returning **CF\_DEFER + CF\_ACCEPT**.

-   **Streams.** Blocks send/receive over IPv4 and IPv6 TCP stream sockets. Defers calling acceptance with a zero listen backlog until the connection has finished.

-   **Datagrams.** Verifies sending and receiving of datagrams over IPv4 and IPv6 UDP sockets. Tests both sending datagrams via connect/send/receive and connectionless send to/receive from.

-   **Select.** Verifies **READFDS** notification on both IPv4 and IPv6 TCP sockets for indications of connection establishment, receiving data, and closure of the socket.

-   **Bind.** Verifies bind semantics for IPv4 and IPv6 TCP sockets: basic bind, **SO\_REUSEADDR** binds, and **SO\_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE** binds.

-   **ReadFile/WriteFile.** Verifies whether overlapped **ReadFile()** and **WriteFile()** functions work correctly over both IPv4 and IPv6 TCP sockets.

-   **Shutdown.** Verifies **shutdown()** semantics on IPv4 and IPv6 TCP sockets by establishing a connection, posting a blocking receive, and verifying whether calling shutdown completes the receive with zero bytes received.

-   **Addressing.** Verifies the conversion of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from h, decimal, and octal strings to the corresponding socket address structure values (**WSAAddressToString** and **WSAStringToAddress**).

-   **Multicast.** For IPv4 and IPv6, verifies the joining to multicast groups via **IP\_ADD\_MEMBERSHIP** and **IPV6\_ADD\_MEMBERSHIP**, sending and receiving data to the group, and leaving the group.

-   **JoinLeaf.** For IPv4 and IPv6, verifies the joining to multicast groups via **WSAJoinLeaf**, sending and receiving data to the group, and leaving the group.

-   **AsyncSelect.** For IPv4 and IPv6 TCP sockets, verifies that **FD\_CONNECT**, **FD\_SEND**, and **FD\_READ** Windows messages are processed via **WSAAsyncSelect**. Also verifies whether **FD\_CONNECT** is processed when a multicast socket completes **WSAJoinLeaf**.

-   **IOCP.** For IPv4 and IPv6 TCP sockets, makes overlapped receive calls in which the socket is associated with an I/O completion port. Also verifies whether the overlapped completions are processed and all data is received.

-   **RAW socket.** For IPv4 and IPv6, creates raw sockets, sending and receiving Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages via **OVERLAPPED IO**.

-   **PnP.** Verifies whether overlapped address change notification is signaled when non-loopback IP addresses are added to and removed from the first non-loopback.
