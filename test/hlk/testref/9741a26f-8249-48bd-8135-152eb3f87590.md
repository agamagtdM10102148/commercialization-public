-   **Configuration A** - EFI USB is first in the boot order.

-   **Configuration B** - EFI USB is last in the boot order.

Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [WDTF System Fundamentals Testing Prerequisites](wdtf-system-fundamentals-testing-prerequisites.md).

This test requires special firmware (debug firmware) on Windows W RT systems that allows you to clear secure boot keys and turn off secure boot. On non-Windows RT systems, a firmware menu should allow you to perform these actions.

Before you run the test:

1.  Clear all Secure Boot variables.

2.  Set the following registry entries: 

``` syntax
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\iospy\StartOverride /v 0 /t REG_DWORD /d 3 /f
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSDMFilt\StartOverride /v 0 /t REG_DWORD /d 3 /f
```

3.  Make sure that you can set the system under test (SUT) to boot from the USB first. If you cannot make this setting, you must manually boot into the different USB sticks when you are instructed to do so.

4.  You must have two USB flash drives.

When it runs, the test installs UEFISecureBootManualTests.zip on the system under test (SUT). Review the README.TXT file in the zip file for further instructions.

The test operator must respond to the test prompts.

The following certificates are required if they aren't present on the machine:

-   [KEK](http://www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs/MicCorKEKCA2011_2011-06-24.crt)

-   [UEFI CA](http://www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs/MicCorUEFCA2011_2011-06-27.crt)

-   [Windows Production](http://www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs/MicWinProPCA2011_2011-10-19.crt)
