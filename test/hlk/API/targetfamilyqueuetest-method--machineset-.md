# TargetFamily.QueueTest Method (MachineSet)


This method schedules a test to be run against a target family. The test computer is always part of the machine set, this is only for additional test computers.

**Namespace:** Microsoft.Windows.Kits.Hardware.ObjectModel

**Assembly:** Microsoft.Windows.Kits.Hardware.ObjectModel (in Microsoft.Windows.Kits.Hardware.ObjectModel)

**Visual Basic**

`Dim instance As TargetFamily`

`Dim logicalMachineSet As MachineSet`

`Dim returnValue As IList(Of TestResult)`

`returnValue = instance.QueueTest(logicalMachineSet)`

**Visual Basic**

`Public Overridable Function QueueTest ( _`

          `logicalMachineSet As MachineSet _`

**C#**

`public virtual IList<TestResult> QueueTest (`

          `MachineSet logicalMachineSet`

`)`

*logicalMachineSet*

     The list of test computers on which a test should run.

Returns **IList**, which is a list of results for the jobs that were scheduled.

## <span id="Remarks"></span><span id="remarks"></span><span id="REMARKS"></span>Remarks


The machine associated with the selected target is automatically added to the set.

QueueTest will attempt to schedule all of the tests in the current or child objects. If there is a failure, the scheduling of tests is stopped immediatelyand an exception is thrown. As a result, some tests could be scheduled, while others are not.

This is not supported when the project is connected to a package.
