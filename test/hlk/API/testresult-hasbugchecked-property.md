# HasBugchecked Property


Indicates whether a bugcheck occurred on the client machine during the test run.

>[!NOTE]
>  Bugchecks aren't necessarily caused by tests. Additional triage of the crash dump file is required to determine what caused the bugcheck. For example, while running WiFi tests, a display driver might cause a bugcheck.
