# Test.QueueTest Method (Test, Machine) Method


This method schedules tests to be run on a specified set of machines and consolidating the test run with additional compatible tests that are flagged to run as a set as an optimization.

**Visual Basic**

`Public Overridable Function QueueTest(ByVal testList As IEnumerable(Of Test), ByVal machineList As IEnumerable(Of Machine)) As IList(Of TestResult)`

**C#**

`public virtual IList<TestResult> QueueTest(IEnumerable<Test> testList, IEnumerable<Machine> machineList)`

## <span id="Parameters"></span><span id="parameters"></span><span id="PARAMETERS"></span>Parameters


*testList*

     The list of tests to consolidate the test run with.

*machineList*

     A list of machines to run this on.

Returns IList, a list of results for the jobs that were scheduled.

## <span id="Remarks"></span><span id="remarks"></span><span id="REMARKS"></span>Remarks


An exception is thrown if:

-   The *ScheduleOptions* member of the test is not *ConsolidateScheduleAcrossTargets*.

-   The tests differ by their Id fields and are therefore not the same test running against different targets.

-   The tests validate different product instances.

-   All of the tests cannot run on a least one machine.
