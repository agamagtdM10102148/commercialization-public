# Troubleshooting Device.Connectivity Testing


To troubleshoot issues with PCI device, USB devices, or USB hub connectivity tests, follow these steps:

1. Review:

   - [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md)

   - The following topics, depending on the device type:

     -   [PCI Device.Connectivity Testing Prerequisites](pci-deviceconnectivity-testing-prerequisites.md)

     -   [Proximity Device.Connectivity Testing Prerequisites](proximity-deviceconnectivity-testing-prerequisites.md)

     -   [USB Device.Connectivity Testing Prerequisites](usb-deviceconnectivity-testing-prerequisites.md)

     -   [USB Hub.Connectivity Testing Prerequisites](usb-hubconnectivity-testing-prerequisites.md)

   - 

2. Verify that you have installed the latest Windows HLK filters and kit updates. For more information, see [Windows Hardware Lab Kit Filters](../user/windows-hardware-lab-kit-filters.md).

3. For a test failure, look for usable information in the Windows HLK Studio test log. If you find usable information, resolve the issue and rerun the test.

4. If you cannot obtain a successful test result, contact [Windows HLK Support](../user/windows-hlk-support.md).

The advantages of connecting a device to a USB 2.0 hub are as follows:

-   We recommended this connection for regular USB devices.

-   This connection is required for the USB Selective Suspend test. For more information, see [USB Internal Device Idle Test - Compat](06e1e2d7-ac7c-4ded-82f7-9c6a31386880.md).

-   This connection forces the Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) high-speed controller to enumerate low-speed and full-speed devices.

The disadvantages of connecting a device to a USB 2.0 hub are as follows:

-   Devices that have embedded hubs must be directly connected for certification tests.

-   We do not recommend multi-TT (transaction translator) hubs for certification testing.

When you are testing a device that has an embedded high-speed hub, attach the device directly to the system for all tests.
