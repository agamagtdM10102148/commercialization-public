# <span id="p_hlk_test.d1f2fbbe-d5e4-439d-819a-dc100df0e9ba"></span>SCSI Compliance Test 2.0 (LOGO)


This automated test verifies that a block storage device (RAID adapter or disk target) that is supported by the operating system fully complies with the Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) standards described in the SCSI-3 Primary Commands-3 (SPC-3) or later, and SCSI Block Commands-2 (SBC-2) or later specifications. To see these specifications, go to [Technical Committee T10 SCSI Storage Interfaces](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=237712).

Ensuring that the block device and the operating system maintain compliance with these standards results in a more robust and reliable system. Although some block devices might not be using a SCSI transport, the operating system communicates with them using SCSI commands (except for individual ATA disk drives that are not part of a RAID set).

The test uses SCSI pass-through requests (IOCTL\_SCSI\_PASS\_THROUGH) to construct and send SCSI command descriptor blocks (CDBs) to the device. The test evaluates the results of the commands to verify compliance.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> If you are running this test as a part of a Storage RAID Hardware-based RAID (Storage Array) submission, and your storage array supports Multipath I/O (MPIO), you must configure your MPIO to use Fail-Over Only policy, and set the target storage disk to use the same active path for all MPIO-capable disks.

If you are running this test as a part of a Storage RAID Hardware-based RAID (Storage Array) submission, make sure that LUN0 is configured as the largest size non-boot LUN.

## <span id="Running_the_test"></span><span id="running_the_test"></span><span id="RUNNING_THE_TEST"></span>Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements for the type of storage controller that you are testing. See [Hard Disk Drive Testing Prerequisites](hard-disk-drive-testing-prerequisites.md) for more information.

## <span id="Troubleshooting"></span><span id="troubleshooting"></span><span id="TROUBLESHOOTING"></span>Troubleshooting


For generic troubleshooting of HLK test failures, see [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md).

For general troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting Device.Storage Testing](troubleshooting-devicestorage-testing.md).

Also, the test writes the results to the log files Scsicompliance.wtl and Scsicompliance.wtl.txt. You can use the results to determine:

-   If a device is compliant with the SCSI specification

-   The optional SCSI commands that are supported by a device

To pass, the SCSI device must support every mandatory command and must be fully compliant with those commands. Each command has a different threshold for pass or fail, and the expectations are specified explicitly in the test and in the log file.

Optional commands are also tested. If a device supports the optional commands and the commands are found to be non-compliant, the test fails. If the device does not support optional commands, the test passes.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Errors from this test occur via issues identified in the log file and in stop errors produced through stressing the driver under test.



During the test, if you are having trouble removing a LUN that is failing or are unable to create a LUN from the storage controller, follow these steps:

1.  Prior to running this test, verify that the storage device works properly. Open diskmgmt.msc, select the disk, and make sure that you can put the device Online and Initialized.

2.  Restart the Windows HLK test computer.

3.  Select and rerun the SCSI Compliance Test 2.0. Do not run any test before it.

4.  Run the SCSI Compliance Test (not the SCSI Compliance Test 2.0 (LOGO)) on the same test client and same test storage device. If the test fails again, verify that the storage device is working properly. If the test fails during steps 3 and 4, run the individual failing command data blocks (cdbs) one at a time with the logging verbosity level set to 4 (the highest level of test logging). This will show what data was sent and what data was returned. A test can fail after several cdbs are completed but pass standalone. If this occurs, there is a problem in the firmware or the test.

If you have a device reset that results in the device falling off the bus and subsequent commands to fail, follow these steps:

1. Copy the test binary (Scsicompliance.exe) from the Windows HLK controller. This file is located at \\\\controllername\\tests\\\[processorarchitectureofyourclient\]\\NTTEST\\DriversTest\\storage\\wdk\\

2. Copy the wttlog.dll file from the Windows HLK controller. This file is located at \\\\&lt;controllername&gt;\\Tests\\&lt;processorarchitectureofyourclient &gt;\\wtt

3. Place both of these files on the test computer in a separate folder.

4. From a command prompt, from the directory containing the test binary, type the following command: Scsicompliance.exe /device &lt;deviceID&gt; /verbosity 4 /operation test /scenario &lt;scenario&gt; /CDB &lt;failingcdbname&gt;

   > [!NOTE]
   > 
   > DeviceID and scenario values can be found by checking the repro line within the test log. The failingcdbname can be found by running the test binary with the /?option (scsicompliance.exe /?).



5. Go back to the same directory and review the results to see if you can determine the reason for the test failure.

6. If you need additional help, collect the txt and wtl logs and share the logs with Microsoft Customer Support.

If you are running this test against Windows Server 2003, make sure the disks or LUNs are not MPIO pseudo-LUNs. MPIO on Windows Server 2003 is not supported.
