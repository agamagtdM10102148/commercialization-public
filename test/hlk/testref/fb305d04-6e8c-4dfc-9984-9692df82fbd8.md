The Fuzz Misc API tests are tests that determine whether the driver can handle a variety of common calls from kernel mode drivers.

The suite tests the following:

-   Calls to [ZwReadFile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567072) and [ZwWriteFile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567121), specifying valid data buffer pointers, varying lengths (including zero), and varying byte offsets, including zero, -1 and 64-bit bytes offsets.
-   Calls to cancel I/O and flush buffers.
-   A series of directory query calls using common file information classes with valid user data buffer pointers and varying buffer lengths (including zero).
-   Directory query calls similar to those issued by programs running under control of the Virtual DOS Machine (VDM).
-   Calls to retrieve the extended attributes of a file with varying buffer sizes and lengths.
-   Calls to create and close section objects, with varying section page protection and sectional allocation attributes (committed section, image file section).
-   Calls to lock and unlock files.
-   Calls to retrieve quota entries for a volume.
-   File Attributes Test, a series of file attribute queries with valid pointers to an ObjectAttributes structure.

    The File Attributes Test has an optional zero-length test. While retrieving the extended attributes of a file, the Fuzz test passes a blank (zero-length) query and an invalid buffer address to the driver.

| **Wpa2PskAesSsid**                       | Required ONLY if DUT or one of its child devices is a WiFi adapter. Please provide SSID of a WPA2 AES WiFi network that the test can use to test the WiFi adapter. The default is 'kitstestssid'.                                                       |
