# Manufacture


## <span id="purpose"></span>Purpose


Use the manufacturing tools to deploy your Windows [customizations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt269765.aspx) to new Windows 10 devices. Learn how to:

-   Combine your customizations, plus languages, drivers, apps and more, into new Windows images.
-   Modify these images either from a manufacturing mode for a familiar Windows experience, or from a command line for quicker changes that can be automated and scripted.
-   Install images onto new devices. Choose whether to use compression to balance disk space verses device performance. Use flashing tools to speed up the final manufacturing processes
-   Capture your customizations into the recovery tools, helping your customers get back up to speed quickly.
