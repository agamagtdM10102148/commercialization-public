# WDTF System Fundamentals Testing Prerequisites


This section describes the tasks that you must complete before you test a client or server system using the Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK). System Fundamentals is a collection of tests that apply to both client and server systems and must be run in addition to the system type you want to certify. Review the respective prerequisite topic for the system you are building.

-   For client systems, see [System Client Testing Prerequisites](system-client-testing-prerequisites.md)

-   For server systems, see [System Server Testing Prerequisites](system-server-testing-prerequisites.md)
