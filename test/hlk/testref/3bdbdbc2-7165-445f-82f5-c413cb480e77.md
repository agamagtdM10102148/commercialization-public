This automated test determines whether a server platform delivers the minimum set of resources that are required to enable Windows Hardware Error Architecture Hardware Compliance Test (WHEAHCT). It is a tool provided by the WHEA feature team to certify OEMs or ODMs platform support for WHEA, a Windows Reliability Availability and Serviceability feature.

This test can run on x64- and Itanium-based platforms running firmware compliant with the Windows Hardware Error Architecture Platform Design Guide. The system must be running a version of Windows Server 2008 R2 or later version of the Windows Server operating system. On IA64, a PSHED plug-in test driver (plugin.sys), which is supplied with the test tool, must be installed on the system. The driver is needed to inject machine check errors into the system.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The test injects a fatal error from the platform to the operating system. The operating system reacts to this fatal hardware error as if it is a real error. Because fatal hardware errors result in blue screen errors with Stop code 0x00000124, the fatal error part of the test will produce a system crash and result in a blue screen and reboot. If configured correctly, see the note below.
> 
> [!NOTE]
> 
> Automatic reboot after a system crash is a configurable behavior of the operating system. For correct execution of the test, the operating system must be configured to perform either a kernel dump or a minidump and reboot automatically. You can confirm these settings using the Control Panel System and Security System Advanced system settings Startup and recovery.
