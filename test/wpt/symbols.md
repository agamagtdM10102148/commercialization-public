# symbols


Enables and configures symbol decoding support.

```
xperf -i <trace file>… [-o output] -symbols [cacheonly] [verbose]
```

## Parameters


<a href="" id="cacheonly"></a>*cacheonly*  
This option speeds symbol decoding for traces with many binary images that lack symbol files after all interesting symbol files have been transcoded.

<a href="" id="verbose"></a>*verbose*  
Verbose mode. Prints symbol paths and version information. For more information, see [Loading Symbols](loading-symbols.md).

Symbol decoding support uses the environment variables in the following table for further configuration of SymCache.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>_NT_SYMCACHE_PATH</p></td>
<td><p>Specifies the path to the local SymCache directory. By default, \SymCache is used.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

**Note**  
For symbol decoding, the trace must be a kernel trace (or a user trace processed in conjunction with a kernel trace) that has the PROC\_THREAD+LOADER kernel flags enabled and that has been stopped and merged with `-d` or with `-merge` on the computer on which it was taken. Xperf performs a special image identification process during its custom trace merge that enables symbol decoding.

 

## Remarks


If this action is not specified on the command line, symbol decoding is disabled.
