This test initiates a rebalance procedure which results in the IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_STOP\_DEVICE PnP IRP to the device driver.

If any driver in the stack fails this IRP the rebalance procedure is abandoned. Please note that in Windows Vista, there is support for multi-level rebalance. If a rebalance is started on a non-leaf device node, all of the device stacks that are present in the device tree with that device node as the root also go through rebalance. And if any of the child device stacks fails query stop, the whole rebalance procedure is abandoned. So drivers must not fail query stop without a genuine reason to do so. If this failure happens, the PnP manager sends cancel stop (IRP\_MN\_CANCEL\_STOP) to all the device stacks that had been sent query stop.

If all of the device stacks involved pass query stop, the test continues with the rebalance and sends the IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_RESOURCE\_REQUIREMENTS and IRP\_MN\_FILTER\_RESOURCE\_REQUIREMENTS IRPS to find the resource requirement of the devices.

After this point, two different paths are possible depending on whether the target device consumes any resources or not:

-   If the device does not consume any resources, the PnP manager itself sends a cancel stop (IRP\_MN\_CANCEL\_STOP\_DEVICE) as an optimization.

    If the device actually consumes resources, the rebalance procedure is completed with the IRP\_MN\_STOP\_DEVICE and IRP\_MN\_START\_DEVICE IRPs.

With this test, the resources of the device do not change.

-   **Test binary:** Devfund\_PnPDTest.dll
-   **Test method:** PNPTryStopAndRestartDevice

The Disable Enhanced Device Testing (EDT) Support test uninstalls the test filter driver (msdmfilt.sys) as an upper filter on devices specified using the DQ parameter. This test filter gets installed as part of running tests in this test category

-   **Test method:** DisableEnhancedDeviceTestingSupport
