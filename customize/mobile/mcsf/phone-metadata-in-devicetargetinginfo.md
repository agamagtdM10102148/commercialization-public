# Set phone metadata in DeviceTargetingInfo

Partners are required to set certain device metadata, including hardware, support, and OEM and MO information.

Partners are required to set the following information:

* OEM and mobile operator information, used for display strings in the UI, device update, and connecting to the Microsoft Store.
* Hardware component versions and software versions, used for targeting updates to devices and for user support.
* A required phone number and optional website for user support, which appears in the **About** screen in **Settings**.

<a href="" id="constraints-"></a>**Constraints:**

* **ImageTimeOnly** – For those settings to put directly into the registry hive.
* **FirstVariationOnly** – For those settings that can be configured at runtime and potentially based on SIM value.

## Instructions

2. Specify an `Owner` and configure the targets and conditions for the variant.
3. Specify a value for each of the following settings.

    Settings that are **ImageTimeOnly**:

    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody valign="top">
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>PhoneManufacturer</strong></p></td>
    <td><p><strong>Required.</strong> This setting must contain a code specified by Microsoft that corresponds to the OEM. This setting must not be changed over time, even if an OEM name changes (such as in a merger); the original OEM name must continue to be specified.</p>
    <p>This setting is used for targeting device updates, for connecting to the store-within-a-store in the Microsoft Store, and for Watson reports. It also appears as part of the device friendly name on the Welcome screen, the <strong>About</strong> screen in <strong>Settings</strong>, the Ringtone list, and on the computer.</p>
    <p>The value must be a valid OEM ID. To get the valid OEM ID that applies to you, contact your Microsoft representative.</p>
    <p>The OEM ID value is in all capital letters, for example, FABRIKAM.</p>
    <p>To use an OEM-provided value to display in the <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> screen, OEMs can use the optional <strong>PhoneManufacturerDisplayName</strong> setting. For more information, see the next entry in this table.</p>
    <p>The <strong>PhoneManufacturer</strong>, <strong>PhoneManufacturerModelName</strong>, and <strong>PhoneMobileOperatorName</strong> should create a unique Phone-Operator-Pairing (POP). </p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">

    <td><p><strong>Optional.</strong> Use this setting to create an OEM-provided value to display in the <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> screen, on apps running on the PC connected to the device through MTP, in the <strong>Manufacturer</strong> field in the device properties window when the device is connected to the PC through MTP, and in the list of backups on OneDrive and during initial device setup on the <strong>Restore backups</strong> page.</p>
    <p>If <strong>PhoneManufacturerDisplayName</strong> is set, the OS does not use the value in the <strong>PhoneManufacturer</strong> setting and uses the OEM-provided value to display in the <strong>About</strong> screen instead. If OEMs do not set a value for <strong>PhoneManufacturerDisplayName</strong>, the OS uses the value in the required <strong>PhoneManufacturer</strong> setting instead.</p>
    <p>When setting the value, OEMs must only use these characters: alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), space, period (<strong>.</strong>), comma (<strong>,</strong>)</p></td>

    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>PhoneFirmwareRevision</strong></p></td>
    <td><p><strong>Required.</strong> This setting represents the complete version of the OEM software on the phone. It is used for targeting phone updates.</p>
    <p>This value has the format uint16.uint16.uint16.uint16. The recommended value is based on the Silicon Vendor (SV) BSP version (major.minor) and the OEM software version (major.minor), with the format &quot;<em>majorSV.minorSV.majorOEM.minorOEM</em>&quot;. The value cannot be &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;.</p></td>

These codes are provided in <a href="registry-values-for-mobile-operator-ids.md" data-raw-source="[Registry values for mobile operator IDs](registry-values-for-mobile-operator-ids.md)">Registry values for mobile operator IDs</a>.

This string must not be changed after the phone is sold.</p>
    <p>This string is for OEM reference and can be set to any value that meets the following requirements:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>The string length must be less than 256 characters</p></li>
    <li><p>The string must be alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 1-9)</p></li>

    <p>OEMs should ensure that this value matches the value of the <strong>ProductString</strong> value under the <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</strong> registry subtree&#39;s <strong>CurrentControlSet\Control\USBFN\Default</strong> subkey.</p>
    <p>Microsoft recommends that partners consider the following when specifying the value for the <code>PhoneModelName</code> setting:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Leave this name blank during development until the phone is ready to enter trials, as applications can collect and read this value.</p></li>
    <li><p>Do not include the manufacturer or OEM name when setting the value for this setting. There are dialogs on the phone that display <code>PhoneManufacturer</code> appended to <code>PhoneModelName</code> so including the OEM or manufacturer’s name when setting <code>PhoneModelName</code> will result in repetitions. For example, if <code>PhoneManufacturer</code> is set to <em>Contoso</em> and <code>PhoneModelName</code> is set to <em>Contoso Phone z102</em>, the result will show up as <em>Contoso Contoso Phone z102</em>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Use a different value for <code>PhoneModelName</code> and another value for <code>PhoneManufacturerModelName</code>. The latter should be as unique as possible for the particular device revision or variant.</p></li>

    <p>For C+G dual SIM phones, OEMs may need to configure this setting. For more information, see <a href="configure-c-g-dual-sim-settings.md" data-raw-source="[Configure C+G dual SIM settings](configure-c-g-dual-sim-settings.md)">Configure C+G dual SIM settings</a>.</p></td>
