# What's new in Windows manufacturing

This topic covers new improvements for desktop, mobile, and IoT manufacturing. 

## <span id="Whats_new_in_desktop_manufacturing"></span> What's new in desktop manufacturing 

**August 4, 2017**

Servicing Stack Update (SSU):KB4022405 is required before applying the most recent General Distribution Release or any future GDRs.

To update install the latest updates: 

-  Download [SSU:KB4022405](http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4022405) and the [latest GDR](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12387/windows-10-update-history) (currently [KB4032188](http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=4032188)) from the [Microsoft Update catalog](http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com).

-  Apply this SSU, and then apply the latest GDR, into both Windows and WinRE.

-  Run DISM /Cleanup-Image /Resetbase.  This step is recommended after any cumulative update, and in this case, it's required to make sure the changes stay in effect after a user resets their PC back to OOBE.

   To learn more about applying updates, see [Lab 5: Add updates and upgrade the edition](desktop/servicing-the-image-with-windows-updates-sxs.md) and [Lab 12: Update the recovery image](desktop/update-the-recovery-image.md).

**July 28, 2017**

- Windows 10 S manufacturing guidance is available. [See Windows 10 S overview](desktop/windows-10-s-overview.md) for information about the manufacturing environment for Windows 10 S.

**April 4, 2017**

- You can now create more than one partition on a USB drive. This allows you to use a single USB drive with a combination of FAT32 and NTFS partitions. To learn more about creating multiple partitions on a USB drive, see [WinPE: Store or split images to deploy Windows using a single USB drive](desktop/winpe--use-a-single-usb-key-for-winpe-and-a-wim-file---wim.md#create-two-partition-drive)

- Windows setup has a new command line option, `/diagnosticprompt`. This setting lets you choose whether the Command prompt is available during Windows setup when pressing Shift+10. See [Windows Setup Command-Line Options](desktop/windows-setup-command-line-options.md) for all available command line options for Windows setup.

- When capturing customizations with ScanState, only use the default config files that come with the ADK. To see more about this change, see [Push button reset overview](desktop/push-button-reset-overview.md#whats-new-for-windows-10).

**January 5, 2017**

- [Install Windows 10 using a previous version of Windows PE](desktop/copy-dism-to-another-computer.md): Added instructions to copy DISM to a separate file location, to help improve WinPE boot performance. Fixed file path errors.

**January 3, 2017**

- [Lab 8: Add branding and license agreements](desktop/add-a-license-agreement.md): added instructions to add an image info file (csup.txt) to the image.

**December 1, 2016**

[OEM deployment lab](desktop/oem-windows-deployment-and-imaging-walkthrough.md): Changed the recommendation for the order to install updates and languages:

- **Add languages before major updates.** Major updates include hotfixes, general distribution releases, or service packs. If you add a language later, you'll need to [reinstall the updates](desktop/servicing-the-image-with-windows-updates-sxs.md).

- **Add major updates before apps**. These apps include universal Windows apps and desktop applications. If you add an update later, you'll need to  [reinstall the apps](desktop/add-universal-apps-sxs.md).

[Lab 7: Change settings, enter product keys, and run scripts with an answer file (unattend.xml)](desktop/update-windows-settings-and-scripts-create-your-own-answer-file-sxs.md): added examples of adding registry keys through Unattend.

[Lab 9: Make changes from Windows (audit mode)](desktop/prepare-a-snapshot-of-the-pc-generalize-and-capture-windows-images-blue-sxs.md#Office_2016): Added instructions for preinstalling Microsoft Office 2016.

[Lab 10: Add desktop applications and settings with siloed provisioning packages (SPPs)](desktop/add-desktop-apps-with-spps-sxs.md): For Microsoft Office, adding Start menu pins is required. You must [add Start tiles and taskbar pins](desktop/add-start-tiles-sxs.md#AppendOfficeSuite). if you don't add it to the Start menu, Windows will remove the Office files during the OOBE boot phase.

[Lab 12: Update the recovery image](desktop/update-the-recovery-image.md): Added recommendation: increase the scratch space in the winre.wim recovery image to speed recovery.   

[Append, apply, and export volume images with a Windows Image (.wim) file](desktop/append-a-volume-image-to-an-existing-image-using-dism--s14.md): Updated (Shows how to manage and combine multiple volume images from a single .WIM file.)

[Compact OS, single-instancing, and image optimization](desktop/compact-os.md#Size_comparisons): Added a comparison table to show the drive space savings when using Compact OS, single-instancing, and when shrinking or removing the hibernation file (hiberfile.sys).

**November 30, 2016**

OEM deployment lab: [Get the sample scripts](desktop/windows-deployment-sample-scripts-sxs.md): ApplyImage.bat now prompts for an image number. 

[WinPE: Mount and Customize](desktop/winpe-mount-and-customize.md#highperformance): Added instructions to build the high-performance power scheme into  WinPE by default.

**November 17, 2016**

[Add Language Packs to Windows](desktop/add-language-packs-to-windows.md): Added Retail Demo experience (Microsoft-Windows-RetailDemo-OfflineContent-Content-fr-fr-Package) to the list of features on demand.

**November 11, 2016**

Servicing Stack Update (SSU):KB3199209 is required before applying the most recent General Distribution Release (GDR, currently KB 3200970) or any future GDRs.

To update install the latest updates: 

-  Download [SSU:KB3199209](http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB3199209) and the [latest GDR](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12387/windows-10-update-history) (currently [KB 3200970](http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=3200970)), from the [Microsoft Update catalog](http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com).

-  Apply this SSU, and then apply the latest GDR, into both Windows and WinRE.

-  Run DISM /Cleanup-Image /Resetbase.  This step is recommended after any cumulative update, and in this case, it's required to make sure the changes stay in effect after a user resets their PC back to OOBE.

   To learn more about applying updates, see [Lab 5: Add updates and upgrade the edition](desktop/servicing-the-image-with-windows-updates-sxs.md) and [Lab 12: Update the recovery image](desktop/update-the-recovery-image.md).

The SSU:KB3199209 addresses two issues:
 
1.	Failure while injecting GDRs into winre.wim – This requires injecting the SSU into winre.wim

2.	Push-button reset failure to keep OEM pre-installed GDRs:

    1.	Half of the fix requires injecting the SSU into the Windows image: This part allows GDRs marked as permanent using /ResetBase to come back after PBR. 

    2.	The other half of the fix requires injecting the GDR into WinRE.wim.

**September 30, 2016**

-  The recommended partition size for the Windows RE partition has shrunk from 500MB to 450MB. Your own Windows RE partition size may vary, based on add-ins like [boot-critical drivers and languages](desktop/add-drivers-langs-universal-apps-sxs.md). 

-  New topic: [Optimize Windows PE](desktop/winpe-optimize.md) helps you boot Windows PE faster after adding customizations like languages or boot-critical drivers.

**September 20, 2016**

-  To deploy individual Windows desktop apps, use [Siloed provisioning packages (SPPs)](desktop/siloed-provisioning-packages.md). To do this, you'll need to run a version of DISM from the Windows ADK, not the built-in version from Windows or Windows PE. The DISM installer program, WimMountADKSetup(x86/amd64).exe should be run from a non-removable drive. For a walkthrough, see [Lab 1f: Add Windows desktop applications with siloed provisioning packages](desktop/add-desktop-apps-with-spps-sxs.md). To get command-line help, use **C:\ADKTools\DISM /Apply-SiloedPackage /?**.

**September 6, 2016**

-  [Features on Demand](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/manufacture/desktop/features-on-demand-v2--capabilities): We've added the list of [all available language features](http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/3/0/830AC3A9-68CF-4F10-9357-F27E0A03148A/Windows%2010%201607%20FOD%20to%20LP%20Mapping%20Table.xlsx).

**September 2, 2016**

-  Updated [push-button reset](desktop/push-button-reset-overview.md), added details about feature changes for Windows 10, Version 1607.  

**September 1, 2016**

-  In Windows 10, Version 1607 language packs from the Windows ADK should not be used for WinRE. Instead, use the language packs available from the language pack ISO.

**August 25, 2016**

-  In Windows 10, Version 1607, it's no longer necessary to remove inbox apps when adding a language pack. If you do try to remove the apps, the DISM command may fail. 
   Updated topics: 
   -  [Add Language Packs to Windows](desktop/add-language-packs-to-windows.md)
   -  [Lab 1d: Add boot-critical drivers, languages, and universal Windows apps](desktop/add-drivers-langs-universal-apps-sxs.md).
   -  [OEM deployment of Windows 10 for desktop editions](desktop/oem-deployment-of-windows-10-for-desktop-editions.md)

**August 15, 2016**

-  In Windows 10, Version 1607, the base recovery (WinRE) image includes a new optional component: WinPE-WiFi-Package. You shouldn’t need to change any of your scripts; this package is not language-specific and does not need to be added or removed when changing the available languages.

**August 4, 2016**

-  Desktop apps, drivers, and settings added in audit mode need to be captured separately so they can be restored by the push-button recovery tools. To learn more, see [Lab 1g: Make changes from audit mode](desktop/prepare-a-snapshot-of-the-pc-generalize-and-capture-windows-images-blue-sxs.md).

-  Desktop apps, drivers, and settings added from siloed provisioning packages (SPPs) are configured automatically. 

**July 26, 2016**

-  New sample script: [WinPE: Identify drive letters with a script](desktop/winpe-identify-drive-letters.md)

**July 21, 2016**

The following changes are new for Windows 10, version 1607:

- Sysprep supports preparing an image that has been upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10. For more information, see [Sysprep Overview](desktop/sysprep--system-preparation--overview.md).

- Siloed provisioning packages are a new type of provisioning package that can capture classic Windows applications individually, drivers plus applications, and more. They provide more flexibility for the manufacturing process and help reduce factory time to build computers that run Windows. ScanState.exe and Dism.exe are both improved to capture and apply siloed provisioning packages, respectively. 

- File names for language packs and language interface packs have been renamed. For examples of the new file names, see [Language packs](desktop/language-packs-and-windows-deployment.md).

- The Chinese (Hong Kong SAR) language pack (zh-HK) is no longer used. The Chinese (Taiwan) language pack (zh-TW) supports both Taiwan and Hong Kong locales. For more information, see [Available Language Packs for Windows](desktop/available-language-packs-for-windows.md).

- Language packs for WinPE and WinRE have been moved to the language packs DVD. OEMs and System Builders with Microsoft Software License Terms can download language packs and LIPs from the [Microsoft OEM site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131359) or the [OEM Partner Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131358).

- A new /Defer parameter can be specified along with /ResetBase when you [reduce the size of the component store](desktop/reduce-the-size-of-the-component-store-in-an-offline-windows-image.md) to defer any long-running cleanup operations to the next automatic maintenance, but we highly recommend that **only** use /Defer as an option in the factory where DISM /ResetBase requires more than 30 minutes to complete.

- A new /EA parameter has been added to Dism /Apply-Image and /Capture-Image commands to capture and apply extended attributes. For Windows, catalog location hints are captured in extended attributes for inbox Authenticate Code scenarios. This enables quicker verification of hashes to ensure system files/components that have not changed. The process of creating the catalog database and those hashes happens on first boot of a Sysprep -Generalized image. If extended attributes are used to capture and apply the image, those attributes will also be carried over, removing the time to re-create them and enabling a faster first boot. For more information, see [DISM Image Management Command-Line Options](desktop/dism-image-management-command-line-options-s14.md). 

- A new Windows Hardware Compatibility Program requirement, [Device.Graphics.AdapterBase.RunFromDriverStore](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/design/compatibility/device-graphics#device-graphics-adapterbase), can impact OEM preloads. Drivers must be written so that their components can be run directly from the Driver Store. Drivers are installed at %SystemRoot%\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository.
