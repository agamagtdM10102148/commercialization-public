During random tests, the Fuzz test issues a series of calls to the **DeviceIoControl** function with function codes, device types, data transfer methods, and access requirements that are selected at random from a specified range of values. The calls include input and output buffers with valid and invalid buffer pointers and lengths, and randomly generated content.

The Fuzz test performs the random tests on all devices opened during the [Basic Open Test](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/devtest/penetration-tests--device-fundamentals-#fuzz-basic-open) and additional open tests. You can customize this test by using the following parameters:

-   Use *MinFunctionCode* and *MaxFunctionCode* to specify the range of IOCTL or FSCTL function codes used in the calls
-   Use *MinDeviceType* and *MaxDeviceType* to specify the range of device types used in the calls
-   Use *SeedNumber* to specify a seed number for the random number generating routine.

The function that the Fuzz test uses to generate random numbers for the test uses a *seed number*, a starting number for the random-number-generating algorithm. To reproduce the test conditions, use the seed number parameter to specify the seed number that was used in the original test trial.

A *Tailored Random Test* is included as part of the random test. The tailored random test uses the results of the random test to examine the drivers response to FSCTL requests in more detail. The tailored random test probes areas that the random test missed and those on which the driver did not respond as expected based on the status returned by the random test calls.
