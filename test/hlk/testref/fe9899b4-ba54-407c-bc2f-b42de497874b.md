This automated test verifies that the graphics driver provides stability and reliability when an active Miracast session is stopped by hibernation and then started again after system resume. The test installs a software device to emulate Miracast sink, starts a session, and then forces transition into a hibernate state if the system supports it.

Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Graphic Adapter or Chipset Testing Prerequisites](graphic-adapter-or-chipset-testing-prerequisites.md).

For generic troubleshooting of HLK test failures, see [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md).

For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting Device.Graphics Testing](troubleshooting-devicegraphics-testing.md).

The test generates an RTSP message log file: **virtualsinklog.{…}.txt**. The actual name of this file can be found in the test log file. For example:

`Message   6/13/2013 7:39:22.724 PM      RTSP log file: virtualsinklog.{3D55759A-4BB2-43C6-9AD6-9D98D6726908}.txt`

The test job captures **WirelessDisplay.etl** and **WPP.etl** files. You can find these files by selecting **Child Job Results** in Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) Manager and then browsing job logs for **Wireless Display Cleanup Trace**.

**WirelessDisplay.etl** contains information about the Miracast session from start to stop. Most events are aligned with DDI calls for both the user mode driver (UMD) and kernel mode driver (KMD).  IHV investigating issues might find it useful to look for errors in these DDI events.  The event names should be familiar to the developer because they closely match the DDI names that are used for the wireless feature.  This file can be analyzed by using Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA).

**WPP.etl** contains WPP traces that are captured for the display kernel events related to Miracast. These traces are highly detailed, and should provide adequate information about session failures that is sufficient to debug most issues. These files require access to symbols to decode them. Symbols for the OS should be available to IHVs. The following command line should be used to decode **WPP.etl** in **wpp.txt** is: `netsh trace convert overwrite=yes tmf=..\symbols.pri\TraceFormat WPP.etl`.

All test cases return PASS or FAIL. The test details are available in the test log (**Te.wtl**), which you can view in Windows HLK Studio.
