# IoT Enterprise overview

Windows 10 IoT Enterprise is a full version of Windows 10 that delivers enterprise manageability and security to IoT solutions.

Because it's a binary equivalent to Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows 10 IoT Enterprise shares all the benefits of the worldwide Windows ecosystem, including the same familiar development and management tools as client PCs and laptops. However, when it comes to licensing and distribution, the desktop version and IoT versions differ. 

Windows 10 IoT Enterprise offers both LTSC and SAC options, and OEMs can choose the option they need for their devices. 

This section covers how to build, customize and deploy a Windows 10 IoT Enterprise image with the following labs:
