# Lab 1e: Add a driver to an image


In this lab, we'll add the sample driver: [Toaster](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/6c1981b8504329521343ad00f32daa847fa6083a/general/toaster/toastDrv), package it up, and deploy it to the to a Windows 10 IoT Core device.

## <span id="Prerequisites"></span><span id="prerequisites"></span><span id="PREREQUISITES"></span>Prerequisites

* Create a product folder (ProductB) that's set up to boot to the default (Bertha) app, as shown in [Lab 1a: Create a basic image](create-a-basic-image.md) or [Lab 1c: Add a file and a registry setting to an image](add-a-registry-setting-to-an-image.md).

## <span id="Check_for_similar_drivers"></span>Check for similar drivers

Before adding drivers, you may want to review your pre-built Board Support Package (BSP) to make sure there's not already a similar driver. 

For example, review the list of drivers in the file: \\IoT-ADK-AddonKit\\Source-arm\\BSP\\Rpi2\\Packages\\RPi2FM.xml.

- If there's not an existing driver, you can usually just add one.

- If there is a driver, but it doesn't meet your needs, you'll need to replace the driver by creating a new BSP. We'll cover that in [Lab 2](create-a-new-bsp.md).

## <span id="Create_your_test_files"></span><span id="create_your_test_files"></span><span id="CREATE_YOUR_TEST_FILES"></span>Create your test files

-  Complete the steps listed under the [Toaster Driver sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/6c1981b8504329521343ad00f32daa847fa6083a/general/toaster/toastDrv) to build it. You'll create a file, wdfsimple.sys, which you'll use to install the driver.

   You can also use your own IoT Core driver, so long as it doesn't conflict with the existing Board Support Package (BSP).

-  Copy the files, wdfsimple.sys and wdfsimple.inf, into a test folder, for example, C:\wdfsimple\.

1.  In the IoT Core Shell, create a **driver package** using [New-IoTDriverPackage](https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-adk-addonkit/blob/master/Tools/IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTDriverPackage.md)

    ``` powershell
    Add-IoTDriverPackage C:\wdfsimple\wdfsimple.inf Drivers.Toaster
    (or) newdrvpkg C:\wdfsimple\wdfsimple.inf Drivers.Toaster
    ```

    This creates a new folder at `C:\MyWorkspace\Source-<arch>\Packages\Drivers.Toaster`.

    This also adds a FeatureID **DRIVERS_TOASTER** to the `C:\MyWorkspace\Source-<arch>\Packages\OEMFM.xml` file.

2.  Build the package using [New-IoTCabPackage](https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-adk-addonkit/blob/master/Tools/IoTCoreImaging/Docs/New-IoTCabPackage.md)

    ``` powershell
    New-IoTCabPackage Drivers.Toaster
    (or) buildpkg Drivers.Toaster
    ```

1.  Update the product test configuration file using [Add-IoTProductFeature](https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-adk-addonkit/blob/master/Tools/IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTProductFeature.md)

    ``` powershell
    Add-IoTProductFeature ProductB Test DRIVERS_TOASTER -OEM
    (or) addfid ProductB Test DRIVERS_TOASTER -OEM
    ```

## <span id="Build_and_test_the_image"></span><span id="build_and_test_the_image"></span><span id="BUILD_AND_TEST_THE_IMAGE"></span>Build and test the image

Build and flash the image using the same procedures from [Lab 1a: Create a basic image](create-a-basic-image.md). Short version:

1.  From the IoT Core Shell, build the image (`buildimage ProductB Test`).
2.  Install the image: Start **Windows IoT Core Dashboard** > Click the **Setup a new device** tab >  select **Device Type: Custom** >
3.  From **Flash the pre-downloaded file (Flash.ffu) to the SD card**: click **Browse**, browse to your FFU file (C:\\IoT-ADK-AddonKit\\Build\\&lt;arch&gt;\\ProductB\\Test\\Flash.ffu), then click **Next**.
4.  Enter device name and password. Put the Micro SD card in the device, select it, accept the license terms, and click *Install**. 
5.  Put the card into the IoT device and start it up.

**Check to see if your driver works**

1.  Use the procedures in the [Toaster Driver sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/6c1981b8504329521343ad00f32daa847fa6083a/general/toaster/toastDrv) to test your driver.
