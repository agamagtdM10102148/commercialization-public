# Power and battery user experience requirements


The checklist in this article contains requirements that the power supply and battery subsystem must meet to achieve a satisfactory overall user experience.

For each requirement in the checklist, the column marked "Applies to S3/S4" indicates whether the requirement applies to PCs that implement the traditional ACPI S3 and S4 power states. The column marked "Applies to CS" indicates whether the requirement applies to PCs that implement the modern standby power model, which is supported starting with Windows 8. Any exceptions to these requirements are noted.
