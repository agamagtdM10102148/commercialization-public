# Feature manifest file contents


*Feature manifest (FM) files* are used to define specific types of image builds that contain different sets of optional packages. This topic describes the required and optional elements in a FM file. For more information about how FM files are used while generating images, see [Building a phone image using ImgGen.cmd](building-a-phone-image-using-imggencmd.md).

**Note**  
Most of the elements in a FM file include a path to a package. If the package is under the root directory for Microsoft packages (%WPDKCONTENTROOT%\\MSPackages), this path can use the $(mspackageroot) macro in the path name. If the package is in some other location, you can use an environment variable, such as %oempackageroot%, and set this environment variable in the command-line window.



## Example FM file


The following example shows a sample OEM FM file.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<FeatureManifest xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
  xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
  xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/embedded/2004/10/ImageUpdate">
  <BasePackages>
    <PackageFile Path="%oempackageroot%\common\" 
      Name="Contoso.Phone.Test.BaseOs.EnvPath.spkg" />
  </BasePackages>
  <Features>
    <OEM>
     <PackageFile Path="%oempackageroot%\test\" 
      Name="Contoso.Test.MinTE.spkg">
        <FeatureIDs>
          <FeatureID>TEST_FEATURE1</FeatureID>
        </FeatureIDs>
      </PackageFile>
   </OEM>
</Features>
  <ReleasePackages> 
    <PackageFile FeatureIdentifierPackage="true" Name="Contoso.BaseOS.BootApplications_Test.spkg" 
Path="%oempackageroot%\test" ReleaseType="Test"/> 
  </ReleasePackages> 
  <PrereleasePackages>
    <PackageFile ID="Contoso.MainOS.Protected_Replacement_Production" FeatureIdentifierPackage="true" 
Name="Contoso.MainOS.Protected_Replacement_Production.spkg" Path="%oempackageroot%\Merged\" Resolution="*" Type="replacement" Language="*"/>
  </PrereleasePackages>
<OEMDevicePlatformPackages>
    <PackageFile Name="SoCVendor.DCD6000.OEMDevicePlatform.spkg" Path="%oempackageroot%\DCD6000\" Device="DCD6000"/>  
</OEMDevicePlatformPackages>
</FeatureManifest>
```

You may wish to examine MSOptionalFeaturesFM.xml that is included with the mobileOS packagesunder %WPDKCONTENTROOT%\\FMFiles to see additional FM XML files.

## Elements in a FM file


The following sections describe the supported elements in a FM file.

### FeatureManifest

The **FeatureManifest** element is the root XML element in the FM file. This element is the base container element for all other elements in the file. It must occur only once.

### BasePackages

The **BasePackages** element specifies packages that are always included in the image if the FM file is referenced in the **AdditionalFMs** element of the OEMInput XML file. The **BasePackages** element has no supported attributes.

The following table describes the child elements of the **BasePackages** element.

</ul></td>

</table>



### Features

There are both **Microsoft** and **OEM** elements, each of which can contain **Features**. The OEM should only add their features to the **&lt;OEM&gt;** element. This provides multiple benefits, including the easier integration of newer versions of the OEMInput.xml files into the OEM’s build system.

The **Features** element defines one or more optional features that can be referenced in the **Features** element in the OEMInput file to include optional packages in the image. The **Features** element has no supported attributes.

The following table describes the child elements of the **Features** element.
