# Step 8: View test results and log files


The **Results** tab displays detailed information about each test. As each test completes, the status column updates with the result--pass or fail.

The following image shows the Studio **Results** tab.

If a test fails, you can expand the test details to review the associated log file.

1.  From the list, select a failed test, indicated by a red X.

2.  Expand the **Test Name** node, expand the **Logs** node, and then double-click the log file.

    You can review these log files:

    -   **.log file.** Text dump.

    -   **.wtl file.** Open to view error reports.

    -   **.xml file.** Change file name extension to .wtl to view error reports.

Right-click any test to see additional test details, including:

-   Task logs

-   Additional files

-   Applied filters

-   Errors

-   Infrastructure (gather and execution logs)
