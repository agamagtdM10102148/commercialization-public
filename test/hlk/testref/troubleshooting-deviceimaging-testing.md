# Troubleshooting Device.Imaging Testing


To troubleshoot issues that occur with Device.imaging tests, follow these steps:

1. Review [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md).

2. Review one of the following topics, depending on whether you are testing a printer or a scanner

   -   [Printer Testing Prerequisites](printer-testing-prerequisites.md)

   -   [Scanner Testing Prerequisites](scanner-testing-prerequisites.md)

   -   [Web Services on Devices Testing Prerequisites](web-services-on-devices-testing-prerequisites.md)

3. Review the [Windows HLK release notes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=236110) for current test issues.

4. For a test failure, look for usable information in the Windows HLK Studio test log. If you find usable information, resolve the issue and rerun the test.

When testing your printer over TCP/IP, if the Device.Imaging.Printer.Base feature is not being detected, you may need to go to the **Device Manager** view under **Selection** and manually select all of the devnodes that correspond to the print device.
