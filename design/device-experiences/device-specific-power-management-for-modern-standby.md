# Device-specific power management for modern standby


To achieve long battery life in modern standby, a platform must be able to operate at a very low hardware power floor. The term power floor describes the hardware power state in which all devices are idle and inactive, and power consumption is dominated by hardware static leakage. If properly designed, the platform typically spends well over 90 percent of a modern standby session operating at the platform's power floor.

To reliably operate at the power floor requires each device outside the System on a Chip (SoC) to enter very low standby power state when it is unused. The power management methodology and system configuration used to achieve power-floor operation is device-specific. Power to a device might be controlled autonomously by the device, based on commands from software drivers. Or, power to the device might be managed by ACPI firmware that controls power management hardware external to the device.

This section describes the supported power management configurations for devices outside of the SoC (or core silicon) in a Windows platform that implements the modern standby power model. For each class of device, the supported hardware and software power management configurations are described. The driver developer for a device should work closely with the device vendor and system integrator to review platform schematics, device integration, and ACPI firmware.

**Note**  This documentation describes the power management configurations that Windows supports for device classes that are commonly used in modern standby platforms. This documentation does not introduce Windows Certification requirements or explicitly discuss such requirements.
