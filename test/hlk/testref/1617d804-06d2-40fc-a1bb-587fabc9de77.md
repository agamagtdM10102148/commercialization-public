This test performs thousands of create-open-close sequences and employs several different ways of opening and closing instances of the specified device or devices: Basic Open Operations, Direct Device Open Operations, and an Open and Close stress test.

### <span id="Basic_Open_Operations"></span><span id="basic_open_operations"></span><span id="BASIC_OPEN_OPERATIONS"></span>Basic Open Operations

During the Basic Open Operations, the Fuzz test repeatedly opens (creates) instances of the specified devices or the devices exported by the specified driver by using different methods and options.

The Fuzz test always performs the Basic Open Operations. You do not need to select them and you cannot exclude them from a test session.

The Fuzz test performs all open operations in user mode by calling system services (ZwXxx Routines) that are appropriate to the device. If an open call returns a handle to the device, the Fuzz test uses the handle to perform the other device tests selected for the test session.

There are five types of Basic Open Operations:

-   **Standard open:** the Fuzz test opens the device asynchronously and specifies only the native device name.
-   **Open with added backslash:** the Fuzz test issues an open call for the device name followed by a backslash (), such as \\device\\cdrom\\, as though the call were to open a root directory within the device.

    This operation determines how the driver or file system manages open requests in its namespace. In particular, if the device does not support open requests in its namespace, the driver must prevent unauthorized access, either by failing the requests, or by setting the FILE\_DEVICE\_SECURE\_OPEN device characteristic when it calls [IoCreateDevice](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548397) or [IoCreateDeviceSecure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548407) to create the device object.

-   **Open as a named pipe:** the Fuzz test opens the device and establishes a named pipe to the device. The access parameter (ShareAccess) is initially set to read and write, but is adjusted if the request fails. If the device does not support named pipes, it should fail the request.
-   **Open as a mailslot:** the Fuzz test opens the device as a mailslot. If the device does not support this type of connection, it should fail the request.
-   **Open as a tree connection:** the Fuzz test opens the device as a tree connection for use in remote network access. The access parameter (ShareAccess) is initially set to read and write, but is adjusted if the request fails. If the device does not support this type of connection, it should fail the request.

The parameters used in the open calls vary to accommodate the characteristics of the device and make it likely that the calls succeed. For example, if a basic open operation fails because the call did not meet the security requirements of the device, the Fuzz test repeats the open operation with a request for lesser access. For example, if an open operation that requested write access returns a security violation error, the open is repeated with a request for read access.

### <span id="Direct_Device_Open_Operations"></span><span id="direct_device_open_operations"></span><span id="DIRECT_DEVICE_OPEN_OPERATIONS"></span>Direct Device Open Operations

During the *Direct Device Open Operations*, the Fuzz test opens the device directly, as a device, not as a file in a file system. Direct Device Open Operations are always synchronous. If the call is successful, the Fuzz test uses the handle provided to perform other selected tests.

### <span id="Open_and_Close_Test"></span><span id="open_and_close_test"></span><span id="OPEN_AND_CLOSE_TEST"></span>Open and Close Test

During the *Open and Close Test*, the Fuzz test creates several threads, each of which performs thousands of create-open-close sequences. This tests the driver's ability to handle an extraordinary volume of otherwise simple and anticipated calls.

The Open and Close Test uses the same options used in Basic Open Operation and Open with Added Backslash tests and are performed just prior to these tests.
