# Filtering


Filtering is post-processing of failed task results that match predefined filter criteria and override "fail" task result status to "pass". You can then submit a package for certification for various targets.

A filter represents a set of constraints that you can use to reduce a set of task results. When a task result fails, the log nodes in the selected filters are matched against the task result logs. The fail/pass count for the task results are adjusted based on the number of test cases that are filtered in the log.

A filter is uniquely identified by its filter number and version. Filter status and expiration date indicate whether a filter is active or expired. The title gives a brief description about the filter. Issue description and resolution give more details about the issue and its resolution.

These are the types of filters:

-   Errata, for handling test failures that are due to bugs in test content, operating system, or Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) infrastructure.

-   Contingency, to grant exceptions for specific hardware failures.

-   Auto triage, for troubleshooting the causes of failures. Unlike the errata and contingency filters, the auto triage filters don't change the task results from fail to pass.

You can apply filters to a project that has failed task results. Before you apply a filter, make sure that you have updated the controller with the latest filters from Windows Quality Online Services (Winqual). If there are matching filters on the controller for a failed task result, the task result is filtered. However, a task result can be partially filtered (that is, the number of filtered failures is less than the total number of failures in the task result).

``` syntax
string projectName = "existing project";
string controllerName = args[0];

// first, connect to the server
ProjectManager manager = new DatabaseProjectManager(controllerName);

// load the project that has failing task results
Project project = manager.GetProject(projectName);

// instantiate the filter engine for the database project manager
DatabaseFilterEngine filterEngine = new DatabaseFilterEngine(manager);
            
// apply filters to the project; will try to find matching filters for 
// the failing task results in the project
// it's a synchronous (or blocking) call, and depending on the size of 
// the log files and the number of task results to be filtered in the 
// project, the Filter method might take a while
filterEngine.Filter(project);

// retrieve the filters that were applied to the project
ReadOnlyCollection<IFilter> appliedFilters = project.GetAppliedFilters();
Console.Out.WriteLine("{0} filters were applied for project {1}", 
 appliedFilters.Count, projectName);
```
