|                  HTML Performance Tool in Visual Studio 2012 Update 2                   |     Tool     | This tool helps developers solve issues with UI responsiveness (for example, a blocked UI thread) and latency in visual updates (for example, a UI thread is responsive but visual changes are taking longer than expected to display). The tool presents a holistic set of "events" (logical categorization of CPU utilization) that occur during a period of time, which includes both application logic as well as platform behavior that occur on behalf of your application (for example, layout, GC, network request, image decoding time). |                                           [Microsoft.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2797912/)                                            |
