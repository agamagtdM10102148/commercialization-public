# Troubleshooting Device.Portable Testing


To troubleshoot issues that occur with Device.Portable tests, follow these steps:

1. Review the following Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) topics:

   - [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md)

   - [Device.Portable Testing Prerequisites](deviceportable-testing-prerequisites.md)

2. Make sure that the device appears in **Device Manager** under **Portable Devices**.

3. Some tests require that you log on to the computer as an Administrator. An Administrator account is needed if a test uses a test driver and then needs to revert to the original driver.

4. Verify that you have installed the latest Windows HLK filters and kit updates. For more information, see [Windows Hardware Lab Kit Filters](../user/windows-hardware-lab-kit-filters.md).

5. For a test failure, look for usable information in the Windows HLK Studio test log. If you find usable information, resolve the issue and rerun the test.

6. If you cannot obtain a successful test result, contact [Windows HLK Support](../user/windows-hlk-support.md).
