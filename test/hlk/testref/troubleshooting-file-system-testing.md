# Troubleshooting File System Testing


To troubleshoot issues that occur with File System testing, follow these steps:

1. Review [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md).

2. Review the [Windows HLK release notes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=236110) for current test issues.

3. For a test failure, look for usable information in the Windows HLK Studio test log. If you find usable information, resolve the issue and rerun the test.
