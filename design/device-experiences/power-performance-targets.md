# Power/performance targets

The requirements for each system are dictated by the target market, workload, and form factor.
OEMs should do their own modeling of their devices to determine the best power and performance targets.

Microsoft recommends the following performance goals:

-  500ms to resume from Standby.
-  5% battery rate of drain over 16 hours.
