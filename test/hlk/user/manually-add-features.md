# Manually add features


Sometimes, features that are required for a product type aren't automatically detected on a device. In those cases, you must manually select the missing feature(s) that correspond to your product type. After all of the features have been selected, the product type appears. When you add features to your selection, the tests that are required for those features are automatically added to your list of tests.

1.  Find your product type in the [Windows HLK Product Type Test Matrix](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=264221).

2.  Determine the list of features that are required for your product type.

3.  In the **Selection** tab in HLK Studio, right-click your selection to see a list of features. The check boxes for features that have been automatically detected display as selected.

4.  Select the check box for any missing feature that corresponds to your product type.
