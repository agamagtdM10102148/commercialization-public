# Modern Standby FAQs


Typical questions related to Modern Standby are answered here.

-   **Q:** Which versions of Windows support Modern Standby?

    **A:** Modern Standby is supported on Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) and Windows 10 Mobile. In Windows 8.0 and 8.1, the only supported standby power models were Connected Standby (CS) and S3.

-   **Q:** Can I switch between S3 and Modern Standby by changing a setting in the BIOS? 

    **A:** No, switching the power model is not supported in Windows without a complete OS re-install.

-   **Q:** What if I have a platform that needs to support both Windows 10 and older versions of Windows?

    **A:** The following table describes what happens with platforms in each of a number of configurations. Investigations are still ongoing to determine the behavior of a system configured for Modern Standby that is installed with Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.

    **Note**  The S3 object is not required for Connected Standby or Modern Standby support. However, if it is not available, S3 support won’t be available.
