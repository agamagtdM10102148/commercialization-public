# Mouse Collection


This topic discusses the mouse collection of a Windows Precision Touchpad device, and explains how the collection provides HID-compliant mouse reporting to the Windows host.

A Windows Precision Touchpad device can provide a top-level collection that makes the touchpad appear as a generic desktop mouse (Page **0x01**, Usage **0x02**).

This is especially important for hosts that are not capable of consuming input via the Windows Precision Touchpad collection. Such hosts include, for example, down-level BIOS implementations, or operating systems prior to WindowsÂ 8.1. The mouse collection should support an input report that can, at a minimum, report relative positions (x, y), and left and right buttons. There are no mandatory feature reports associated with this collection. For an example of a mouse collection, see [Sample Report Descriptors](touchpad-sample-report-descriptors.md).

By default, Windows Precision Touchpad devices can report data via the mouse collection, as this is the most compatible reporting mode.
