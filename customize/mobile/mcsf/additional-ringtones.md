# Additional ringtones


OEMs and mobile operators can each preload a set of custom ringtone files on Windows mobile devices, and they can set a default ringtone.

Ringtones should be a maximum of 150 KB and have a length of 5 to 15 seconds. They must be in .wma format, with a compression of 128 kbit/s for stereo or 64 kbit/s for mono. Partner ringtones should play at an appropriate volume relative to other sounds and ringtones, and there should be minimal distortion from the device speaker, at full volume.

**Limitations and restrictions**:

-   The names of the ringtones must be localized for all display languages that ship on the device.

-   Partners must not move, delete, or modify the ringtones provided by Microsoft.

-   Partners can only change the default alert sound used for phone calls – all other ringtone and alert defaults must not be changed unless specified elsewhere in the documentation.

-   Users can delete partner ringtones.

Partners must keep the following design considerations in mind when implementing additional ringtones:

**File size:** Ringtone recommended maximum 150 KB; Alarm 100 KB(others as small as possible)

**Format:** .wma

**Compression:** WMA (128 kbps/stereo; 64 kbps/mono)

**Sound length:** Ringtones 5-15 seconds; Alarm 5-15 seconds; Calendar 1-3 seconds; Alerts 0.5-1.5 seconds

**Appropriate volumes:** Sounds should be appropriately balanced with ringtones and system sounds that ship with the OS.

**Minimal distortion** from device speaker, at full volume.

<a href="" id="instructions-"></a>**Instructions:**  
**To add additional ringtones**

1. Create a .dll that contains the ringtone display name. For more information on how to do this, see [Create a resource-only .dll for localized strings](create-a-resource-only-dll-for-localized-strings.md).

2. Create a customization answer file using the contents shown in the following code sample.

   ```XML
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
   <ImageCustomizations xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/embedded/2004/10/ImageUpdate"  
                        Name="AdditionalRingtones"  
                        Description="Use to add ringtone sound files and set a new default ringtone."  
                        Owner=""
                        OwnerType="OEM"> 
      
      <Static>  

       <Settings Path="Localization/MUI">  
         <!-- Use to add your base MUI DLL file -->
         <Asset Name="BaseDll" Source="" />

         <!-- Use to specify the language MUI packages (*.dll.mui) for the languages you are supporting and have localized strings for -->
         <Asset Name="LanguageDll/$(langid)" Source="" />
         <Asset Name="LanguageDll/$(langid)" Source="" />
         <Asset Name="LanguageDll/$(langid)" Source="" />
         <!-- Add as many as you need -->         
       </Settings>  

       <Settings Path="EventSounds">  
         <!-- Use to add additional ringtones -->
         <Asset Name="Ringtones" DisplayName="@DisplayStrings.dll,-Offset" Source="" Type="" />
         <Asset Name="Ringtones" DisplayName="@DisplayStrings.dll,-Offset" Source="" Type="" />
       </Settings>  

      </Static>

   </ImageCustomizations>
   ```

3. Specify an `Owner`.

4. Add the resource-only .dll that contains the ringtone sounds' display names by setting the `BaseDll` asset to point to the location of your base MUI DLL file. For example: *C:\\Path\\DisplayStrings.dll*.

5. Add the language MUI packages (\*.dll.mui) for all the languages you are supporting and have localized strings for. To do this:

   -   Set the asset's `Name` to `LanguageDll/`*$(langid)* where *$(langid)* corresponds to the language. For example: *LanguageDll/en-US*.

   -   Set the asset's `Source` to the location of the .dll.mui file for that language. For example: *C:\\Path\\en-us\\DisplayStrings.dll.mui*.

   -   Repeat the previous steps for the other languages.

       The following example shows the customization answer file entries for en-US, fr-CA, and es-MX languages:

       ```
       <Asset Name="LanguageDll/en-US" Source="C:\Path\en-us\DisplayStrings.dll.mui” />
       <Asset Name="LanguageDll/fr-CA" Source="C:\Path\fr-CA\DisplayStrings.dll.mui" />
       <Asset Name="LanguageDll/es-MX" Source="C:\Path\es-MX\DisplayStrings.dll.mui" />
       ```

6. Add additional notification sounds by adding a `Ringtones` asset. To do this:

   - Set the asset's `Name` to `Ringtones`.

   - Set the `DisplayName` to the name of the resource-only .dll file and specify the string offset. Replace *DisplayStrings.dll* with the name of your .dll file and replace *Offset* with the correct offset for the localized string. For example: <em>@DisplayStrings.dll,-104</em>.

   - Set `Source` to the full path to the custom ringtone sound on your development machine. For example: *C:\\Path\\MellowRingtone.wma*.

   - Optionally, set `Type` to either `OEM` or `MobileOperator` to distinguish the type of asset. If you do not set the type, this defaults to OEM.

   - Repeat the previous steps for any additional ringtone sounds.

If you are setting the default alarm sound in addition to adding other alarm sound files, see the *To set a new default ringtone* section.

**To set a new default ringtone**

1.  Create a customization answer file using the contents shown in the following code sample or use the sample AdditionalRingtones.xml file.

    ```XML
       <Settings Path="EventSounds">
            <!-- Use to set a new default ringtone -->
            <Setting Name="DefaultRingtone" Value="" />
       </Settings>
    ```

2.  Set the `Value` to the desired default ringtone sound file name. For example: *MellowRingtone.wma*.

<a href="" id="testing-"></a>**Testing:**  
1.  Flash the build containing this customization and multiple display languages to a mobile device.

2.  Go to the **Ringtone** screen in **Settings**.

3.  Verify all added custom ringtones are in the **Ringtone** drop-down list.

4.  If a new default ringtone is set, verify the **Ringtone** drop-down list defaults to the specified ringtone.

5.  Verify the custom ringtone names are correct for all display languages on the device.
