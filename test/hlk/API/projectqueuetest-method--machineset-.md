The machine associated with the target (that was selected) is automatically added to the set.

QueueTest attempts to schedule all of the tests in the current or child objects. If a failure occurs, the scheduling is stopped immediately, and an exception is thrown. As a result, some of the tests might have been scheduled.

This method is not supported when the project is connected to a package.
