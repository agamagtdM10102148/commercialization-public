# Distributing Tests


You can run a test on all the targets in a **TargetFamily**, or you can run a test on a subset of **TargetFamily** targets.

Note that there is no hierarchical relationship from **TargetFamily** to **Target** to tests. If you try to create such a hierarchy, all your distributable tests and their results will be duplicated. Also, the **Target.GetTestResults()** method might return results from the wrong target.

Here's an example test distribution:

System tests are also distributable. The hardware Id for systems is always **\[SYSTEM\]**.
