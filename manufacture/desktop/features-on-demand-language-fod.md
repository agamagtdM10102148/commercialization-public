# Language and region Features on Demand

## <span id="language_capabilities"></span> Language and region-related Features on Demand reference

When you add a language pack to a Windows image, you also add [Features on Demand](features-on-demand-v2--capabilities.md) to enable additional functionality. To view available non-language or region-related Features on Demand, see [Available Features on Demand](features-on-demand-non-language-fod.md).

To see how to add Features on Demand and language packs to your Windows image, see [Add languages to Windows](add-and-remove-language-packs-offline-using-dism.md).

### Language Features on Demand

**Recommendation:** Add FODs after you add a language pack. Preinstall the Basic, Fonts, Text-to-speech, Optical character recognition (OCR), and speech recognition languages you expect users in the device’s target market to need. Additionally, add the handwriting recognition FODs to devices that ship with a pen.

Language Features on Demand are available in six types:

**Note:** Not all Features on Demand are available for every language. You can learn which FODs are available for languages [in the LP to FOD mapping spreadsheet](http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/6/0/7600F9DC-C296-4CF8-B92A-2D85BAFBD5D2/Windows-10-1809-FOD-to-LP-Mapping-Table.xlsx).

### Fonts

When adding languages for some regions, you'll need to add fonts.

Font features on demand provide additional fonts used for particular writing systems and languages. These additional fonts are not required for the Windows to display a language. However, prior to Windows 10, most of these fonts were installed by default on every system, and some were used for user interface display. Customers using particular languages are likely to require the additional fonts related to that language for documents or for user interface strings in applications that run in those languages. The capability names use script identifiers; for example, “Deva” indicates Devanagari script, which is used for Hindi, Konkani and other languages.

**Recommendation:** If a PC will be sold to a certain region, install that region's font (For example, th-TH should be preinstalled on devices shipping to regions with Thai language).
