# Rules for Global Items


The following rules are established for reporting global items in descriptors.

-   A logical range must be provided for all usages.
-   The minimum physical size of a digitizer is one square inch.
-   The recommended (and minimum) time stamp usage report data size is 16 bits.
-   Reported values must always be within the logical range. The only exception is when the usage includes support for **NULL** values.
