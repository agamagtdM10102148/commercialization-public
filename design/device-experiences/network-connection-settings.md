# Network Connection Settings

Under **Network connection**, users have three choices for configuring network connectivity power settings:

- **Never** - Never disconnect from the network when the device is asleep and on battery power.

- **Always** - Always disconnect from the network when the device is asleep and on battery power.

- **Managed by Windows** - Only important apps that have been recently used are permitted to maintain access to the network. Apps designated as important are:
    - Any app that the user sets to **Allow to run background tasks**
    - All VOIP apps
