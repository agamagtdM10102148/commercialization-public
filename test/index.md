# Test for performance and compatibility


We provide an array of tools and technology to help you test performance, compatibility, reliability, and functionality of the hardware and software you create to run with Windows 10. The Windows Hardware Lab Kit (HLK), the Windows Performance Tools (WPT) and the Windows Assessment Toolkit appeal to a wide audience that includes driver developers, hardware manufacturers, system builders, and general application developers.
