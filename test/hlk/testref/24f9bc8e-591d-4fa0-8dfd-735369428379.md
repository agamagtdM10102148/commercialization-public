# <span id="p_hlk_test.24f9bc8e-591d-4fa0-8dfd-735369428379"></span>Wlan Test - Enable and Disable WFD Autonomous GO

This automated test creates a wireless profile that uses the values that are provided in the two parameters and connects to that network.

>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft will be accepting 802.11ad WDI drivers for HLK certification for the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709) to facilitate broad distribution and testing among Windows Insiders and ecosystem partners. However, due to the lack of broad testing of 802.11ad WDI functionality, this feature is enabled as a developer preview for the Windows 10, version 1709 release. 
>
>If a problem is encountered with 802.11ad functionality, please contact your 802.11ad IHV partner for support assistance.   Microsoft is committed to supporting 802.11ad Wi-Fi connectivity in a future version of Windows 10 in order to enable wireless docking and other scenarios.

## <span id="Running_the_test"></span><span id="running_the_test"></span><span id="RUNNING_THE_TEST"></span>Running the test


Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Wireless LAN (802.11) Testing Prerequisites](wireless-lan--80211--testing-prerequisites.md). Make sure that device has been enabled, drivers are properly installed, and the device is properly inserted.

The test does the following:

-   Connect to the specified wireless network by using the created profile.

-   If the driver does not return a connection success message in four seconds, the test fails.

-   If there is a connection failure, the test fails.

-   Wait for up to 45 seconds for the Windows NLM to return network connected status (this waits for DHCP assignment).

-   Choose a target IPv4 address from either the DHCP server on the network or the default gateway (the DHCP server has priority).

-   Send an ICMP message to the target IPv4 address and expect success.

-   Connect to port 80 of the target address and expect either a HTTP 401 challenge or HTTP 200 success.

-   Failure to ping target address or connect to port 80 of target address results in a test failure.

## <span id="Troubleshooting"></span><span id="troubleshooting"></span><span id="TROUBLESHOOTING"></span>Troubleshooting


For generic troubleshooting of HLK test failures, see [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md).

For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting Wireless LAN (802.11) Tests](troubleshooting-wireless-lan--80211--tests.md).

Make sure that the following are true:

-   The specified SSID is within range of the device

-   The specified password is correct.

-   The target IP address can be pinged.

-   The target IP address is running a web server.

Most home routers (including routers that are specified in the Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) WLAN setup) will satisfy these requirements.
