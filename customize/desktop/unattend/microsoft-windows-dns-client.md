# Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client

The Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client component contains settings for configuring the Domain Name System (DNS), a system for naming computers and network services that organizes them into a hierarchy of domains. DNS naming is used on TCP/IP networks, such as the Internet, to locate computers and services by using user-friendly names.

The DNS Client service is used to resolve DNS domain names, by querying locally cached information obtained from a previous query or by querying a remote DNS server.

Some settings are global, and others are interface-specific. Global settings apply to all network adapters on the computer. Interface-specific settings apply only to a single interface and may overlap with global settings.

## In This Section

| Setting                 | Description                                                                           |
|:------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [DNSDomain](microsoft-windows-dns-client-dnsdomain.md) | Specifies the primary DNS suffix of the network connection across all adapters. If <code>DNSDomain</code> is specified in two places as a global parameter (x) and as an interface-specific parameter (y), the two values are concatenated appropriately for each interface (as x, y) and used. |
| [DNSSuffixSearchOrder](microsoft-windows-dns-client-dnssuffixsearchorder.md) | Specifies the suffix search order for DNS servers. This is a global setting. |
| [Interfaces](microsoft-windows-dns-client-interfaces.md) | Specifies an interface collection. |
| [UseDomainNameDevolution](microsoft-windows-dns-client-usedomainnamedevolution.md) | Specifies whether to use domain-name devolution when the DNS-caching resolver resolves an unqualified query. |
