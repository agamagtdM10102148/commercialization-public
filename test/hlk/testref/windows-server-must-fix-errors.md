## <span id="Overview"></span><span id="overview"></span><span id="OVERVIEW"></span>Overview


If your company manufactures a Network or Storage adapter that is to be Certified for Windows Server 2016, there are Code Analysis (CA) and Static Driver Verifier (SDV) driver source code errors which are considered Must-Fix in order for the driver to be successfully certified for Windows Server 2016.

The SDV user interface highlights these errors specifically for NDIS and Network related interface calls that are incorrect and considered Must-Fix in order to get a driver Certified for Windows Server 2016. The Storage interface calls are planned to be called out as well, but that functionality is not complete at this time.

The CA user interface does not currently highlight the errors it detects in Network and Storage driver sources that are incorrect and considered Must-Fix in order to get a driver Certified for Windows Server 2016. That work is planned for future versions of the CA tool.

## <span id="Criteria_for_Rules_Selection_as_Must-Fix"></span><span id="criteria_for_rules_selection_as_must-fix"></span><span id="CRITERIA_FOR_RULES_SELECTION_AS_MUST-FIX"></span>Criteria for Rules Selection as Must-Fix


The criteria for the SDV and CA Rules which have been selected for Network and Storage adapter drivers as being Must-Fix in order to get a driver Certified for Windows Server 2016 are as follows:

-   Accuracy - the Rule finds code errors with a low false failure rate
-   Impact - the code error can cause data corruption, hangs or crashes
-   Data Driven - the code error caused a problem in a driver that crashed and was analyzed as part of Microsoft's Online Crash Analysis tool, OCA.
-   Experience - the code error is one included in the internal bar used by Microsoft, with high impact and security issues always being fixed
-   Minimal Annotation - there is low dependency on annotations of the driver's sources in order for the CA and SDV tools to function. Note however that some annotations are required.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> There are a few CA Rules below for which there are no links in MSDN, which are called out below. The functionality for checking these in Visual Studio Express 2013 does not exist, so other versions of Visual Studio must be used. However, the errors are generally self-explanatory.

For all other Rules, the link can be found by searching on MSDN.

For convenience, there is a short snippet of text from the links, but the links themselves usually contain more text and code examples of both correct and incorrect usage to illustrate the needed change(s).

<span id="QueuedSpinLockRelease"></span><span id="queuedspinlockrelease"></span><span id="QUEUEDSPINLOCKRELEASE"></span>QueuedSpinLockRelease  
This rule verifies that the driver does not call KeReleaseInStackQueuedSpinLock without first acquiring the lock via KeAcquireInStackQueuedSpinLock.

<span id="SpinLock"></span><span id="spinlock"></span><span id="SPINLOCK"></span>SpinLock  
This rule verifies that a call to KeAcquireSpinLock is promptly followed by a call to KeReleaseSpinlock. If a driver calls KeAcquireSpinLockRaiseToDpc or KeAcquireSpinLock again prior to releasing the lock, it fails the rule. In addition, before exiting the dispatch or cancel routine, the driver must release the spin lock.

<span id="SpinLockDpc"></span><span id="spinlockdpc"></span><span id="SPINLOCKDPC"></span>SpinLockDpc  
This rule verifies that a call to KeAcquireSpinLockRaiseToDpc is promptly followed by a call to KeReleaseSpinlock. If a driver calls KeAcquireSpinLock or KeAcquireSpinLockRaiseToDpc again prior to releasing the lock, it fails the rule. In addition, before exiting the dispatch or cancel routine, the driver must release the spin lock.

<span id="StorPortMSILock"></span><span id="storportmsilock"></span><span id="STORPORTMSILOCK"></span>StorPortMSILock  
Miniport drivers are required to acquire the MSI spin lock for a message if, and only if, the InterruptSynchronizationMode member of the PORT\_CONFIGURATION\_INFORMATION (Storport) structure is set to InterruptSynchronizePerMessage. This rule verifies that calls to StorPortAcquireMSISpinLock are only made if the synchronization mode is InterruptSynchronizePerMessage.

This rule verifies that locks that are acquired via StorPortAcquireSpinLock are promptly released via StorPortReleaseSpinLock. The miniport driver fails the rule if it attempts to acquire a lock that it had already acquired, or if it attempts to release a lock that it had not acquired. In addition, at the end of the dispatch or cancel routine, the driver should not hold any spin locks.

<span id="StorPortSpinLock3"></span><span id="storportspinlock3"></span><span id="STORPORTSPINLOCK3"></span>StorPortSpinLock3  
The StorPortSpinLock3 rule verifies the lock acquisition hierarchy that is described in the documentation for the StorPortAcquireSpinLock routine.

<span id="SpNoWait"></span><span id="spnowait"></span><span id="SPNOWAIT"></span>SpNoWait  
This rule verifies that waits or data allocation are not performed inside StartIo.

<span id="SpReturnValue"></span><span id="spreturnvalue"></span><span id="SPRETURNVALUE"></span>SpReturnValue  
This rule verifies that the driver's implementations of HwStorFindAdapter and VirtualHwStorFindAdapter return a valid status. A valid status is one of the following; SP\_RETURN\_FOUND, SP\_RETURN\_ERROR, SP\_RETURN\_BAD\_CONFIG, or SP\_RETURN\_NOT\_FOUND.

<span id="StorPortAllocatePool2"></span><span id="storportallocatepool2"></span><span id="STORPORTALLOCATEPOOL2"></span>StorPortAllocatePool2  
This rule verifies that the miniport makes the correct number of calls to StorPortAllocatePool and StorPortFreePool. If StorPortAllocatePool returns a failure (STOR\_STATUS\_INSUFFICIENT\_RESOURCES), the miniport must not attempt to call StorPortFreePool. In addition, upon exit from a callback, the number of calls to StorPortAllocatePool and StorPortFreePool must be equal.

<span id="StorPortBuildIo"></span><span id="storportbuildio"></span><span id="STORPORTBUILDIO"></span>StorPortBuildIo  
This rule verifies that if the StorPort miniport's StorPortBuildIo routine returns FALSE, the SRB in question is not passed to StartIo. (In such cases, the miniport driver must complete the SRB by calling StorPortNotification with a notification type of RequestComplete from StorPortBuildIo or someplace else).

<span id="StorPortCompleteRequest"></span><span id="storportcompleterequest"></span><span id="STORPORTCOMPLETEREQUEST"></span>StorPortCompleteRequest  
This rule verifies that no calls to StorPortCompleteRequest are made by the miniport. Usage of the StorPortCompleteRequest is not recommended; miniports should instead call StorPortNotification with notificationType = RequestComplete.

<span id="StorPortEnablePassive"></span><span id="storportenablepassive"></span><span id="STORPORTENABLEPASSIVE"></span>StorPortEnablePassive  
This rule verifies that StorPortEnablePassiveInitialization is not called from any StorPort miniport driver routine other than HwInitialize.

This rule verifies that calls to StorPortNotification use only allowed (i.e. documented) notification types.

<span id="StorPortPassiveFromHwInit"></span><span id="storportpassivefromhwinit"></span><span id="STORPORTPASSIVEFROMHWINIT"></span>StorPortPassiveFromHwInit  
StorPortEnablePassiveInitialization should not be called within the HW Initialization entry point for Storport drivers if the HW Initialization entry point can be called directly from the HW Adapter Control entry point.

<span id="StorPortPerfOpts"></span><span id="storportperfopts"></span><span id="STORPORTPERFOPTS"></span>StorPortPerfOpts  
This rule verifies that the PerfConfigData parameter that is passed to StorPortInitializePerfOpts is not NULL.

<span id="StorPortStartIo"></span><span id="storportstartio"></span><span id="STORPORTSTARTIO"></span>StorPortStartIo  
Waits or data allocation must never be performed in the miniport's StartIo routine. The driver fails the rule if it calls StorPortStallExecution or another function that involves time-consuming operations. Since StartIo is synchronized, these calls should mostly be done in BuildIo.

### <span id="Virtual_Miniport"></span><span id="virtual_miniport"></span><span id="VIRTUAL_MINIPORT"></span>Virtual Miniport

<span id="DoubleExFreePool"></span><span id="doubleexfreepool"></span><span id="DOUBLEEXFREEPOOL"></span>DoubleExFreePool
