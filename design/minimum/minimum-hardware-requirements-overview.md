# Minimum hardware requirements


## Section 1.0 - Introduction


### 1.1 Overview

This specification defines the minimum hardware requirements for Windows 10 and all types of devices or computers designed for Windows 10, version 1703 or later versions. Microsoft will build and test the Windows 10 OS against the requirements described in this specification.

### 1.1.1 Purpose of this specification

This specification defines the minimum hardware requirements necessary to:

-   Boot and run Windows 10.
-   Update and service Windows 10.
-   Provide a baseline user experience that is comparable with similar devices and computers.

The goal of this specification is to enable OEMs, ODMs, SoC vendors, and other component vendors to make early design decisions for devices and computers that will run Windows 10.

This specification does not provide compatibility and certification requirements for devices and computers that run Windows 10 or implementation guidance for exceptional user experiences. Microsoft will provide this guidance in other documents at a later date.

### 1.1.2 Windows operating systems

Windows is available in the following editions.

\*An additional 350MB of carve-out is allowed if an OEM chooses to enable hardware-based DRM functionality.

### 2.3 Storage

### 2.3.1 Flash type and layout

Devices that run Windows 10 Mobile must include a minimum of 8GB of nonremovable flash storage, and they must implement a flash storage system using an e•MMC or UFS and optional SD card. See section 6.7.3 for additional requirements for the micro SD card slot.

The e•MMC must use a 512-byte sector size and be configured with a minimum 512 KB Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB).

The UFS must use a 4K sector size and be configured with a minimum 512 KB Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB).

The layout of the flash system store is specified by Microsoft and the SoC vendor. OEMs must not add partitions or remove partitions from this layout.

### 2.3.2 Free up space for update

Devices that run Windows 10 Mobile must include sufficient free space in the system and user partitions for future updates of OEM-owned components. For more information, see the Windows 10 Partner Documentation when it is available.

### <a href="" id="2-3-3-user-flash-"></a>2.3.3 User flash

Devices that run Windows 10 Mobile must include a user partition of size 1 GB or more of internal nonremovable e•MMC or UFS storage.

### 2.3.4 SD card

If an SD card is included in a device that runs Windows 10 Mobile, the SD card must support the SD Association’s SD 2.0 or SD 3.0 specifications [(http://www.sdcard.org/)](http://www.sdcard.org/). The SD 3.0 specification is backward compatible with SD 2.0.

- If Card Emulation is implemented, the NFC controller must be connected to the default (slot 0) UICC slot by using SWP-line as specified by the ETSI. If you cannot connect the SWP line to slot 0 due to physical limitations, the OEM must indicate the slot value to which it is connected by using registry settings. 
  ### 6.4 Sensors

### 6.4.1 Accelerometer

If the device includes an accelerometer sensor, it must support three-axis.

### 6.4.2 Proximity sensor

If the non-desktop device includes a proximity sensor, it must be oriented to sense objects that are close to the device display or resting on the top of the device display.

**Note**  Devices may use the touch controller as a capacitive-based proximity sensing solution instead of an infrared-based proximity sensor.

 

### 6.4.3 Gyroscope

If the device includes a gyroscope sensor, it must support three-axis.

### 6.4.4 Magnetometer

If the device includes a magnetometer, it must support three-axis.

### 6.5 Hardware notifications

Phones that run Windows 10 Mobile must include a vibration mechanism such as a vibration motor, vibration speaker, or haptics transducer controllable by the OS. A vibration mechanism is optional for other devices that run Windows 10. If a vibration mechanism is implemented for devices other than phones, the mechanism is not required to be controllable by the OS.

Devices that run Windows 10 may optionally include notification LEDs (NLEDs).

### 6.6 Hardware button behavior

This section provides behavior requirements for hardware buttons. To determine which hardware buttons are required or optional for each OS and device, see the "Hardware buttons" row in Table 3 and sections 2.6 (for Windows 10 Mobile) and 3.6 (for Windows 10 for desktop editions).

**Note**  The requirements in this section do not apply to Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise. Microsoft recommends that buttons implemented on devices running Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise comply with the requirements in this section, but compliance is not required.

 

### 6.6.1 Button wake up requirements for devices that support low-power idle states

On devices that support low-power idle states, certain hardware buttons must be able to interrupt and wake up the device's application processor from its lowest supported idle state as shown in Table 23. This capability is needed for the OS power policy manager to control when a button press is processed and when it is ignored. This capability does not require the display to come on. A supported device must meet both of the following requirements:

-   They run Windows 10 Mobile or Windows 10 for desktop editions.
-   The LOW\_POWER\_S0\_IDLE\_CAPABLE flag is set in the Fixed ACPI Hardware Table (FADT).

### 6.6.2 Power button behavior

If the Power button is implemented, it must meet the following requirements:

-   When the device is off, pressing the power button must turn on the device. In addition, the device must show activity when it is turned on (such as vibrating or turning on the display).
-   The device must implement a hardware timer to allow for either turning off the device or power cycling the device (turning off the device and then turning it on again) regardless of the current state of the device. This must be implemented by using at least one of the following options:

    -   Press and hold the Power button.
    -   Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Down button at the same time.

    Either of these button options must start the hardware timer. The duration of the timer must be as follows:

    -   For devices that run Windows 10 for desktop editions and support low power idle states, the timer must be 10 seconds.
    -   For devices that run Windows 10 for desktop editions but do not support low power idle states, or for devices that run Windows Server 2016, the timer must be 4 seconds.
    -   For devices that run Windows 10 Mobile, the timer must be 10 seconds.

    For a definition of a device that supports low power idle states, see 6.6.1.

    Releasing any of the buttons used to start the timer must stop the timer. Upon expiration of the timer, the device must either power cycle or turn off the device.

    **Note**  We recommend that the Power and Volume Down combination be used to start a power cycle on devices where the display is the only sign of life (for example, devices with no fan or LED).

     

### 6.6.3 Camera button behavior

If a dedicated camera button is implemented, it can be a dual-action camera button with the ability to detect “half-press” and “full-press” as distinct separate actions or a single-action camera button that does not support a "half-press" functionality.

### 6.6.4 Rotation lock button behavior

A screen rotation lock button can be implemented. The rotation lock button can either be a press button or a slider that is stateless as long as there is no mechanical position.

### 6.7 Connectors

For each of the connector types listed in this section, the following requirements apply to any device that includes the connector type.

### 6.7.1 USB

USB is optional for all devices and computers that run Windows 10. Windows 10 supports the following USB controllers:

-   Function controllers
-   Host controllers
-   Dual-role OTG controllers

Guidance about supporting USB function and host controllers will be provided in the Windows 10 Partner Documentation when it is available.

### 6.7.2 Headphone/headset

If the device includes a 3.5-mm stereo headphone/headset jack, it must meet the following requirements:

-   It must provide stereo output.
-   It must detect insertion and removal of the headphone/headset and generate an interrupt to the OS.
-   It must wake the device if the device is in connected standby mode.

Additionally, if the device supports a headset with a microphone, it must communicate the presence or absence of the headset microphone to the OS.

### 6.7.3 SD card slot

If the device includes an SD card slot, it must meet the following requirements:

-   The SD card slot must be able to support the operation of an SD 3.0 compliant SD card. All SD 3.0 specification requirements [(http://www.sdcard.org/)](http://www.sdcard.org/) such as supply voltage must be met.
-   The SD card slot may optionally support hot swap, that is, insertion or removal while the device is turned on.
-   If the slot supports hot swap, all card insertion/removal events must be reported to the OS and must be wake-up sources for the device. Neither OEM hardware circuitry nor device driver software must take any observable custom actions, such as waking up the device display, based on SD card insertion or removal.
-   If the slot does not support hot swap, it must be designed so that the card cannot be inserted or removed while the device is in normal operation. For example, it could be obstructed by the battery to make it impossible to insert or remove the card when the battery is present.

### 6.7.4 SIM slot

If the device supports a single SIM card, it must include one SIM slot. If the device supports dual SIM, it must include two SIM slots.

If the device includes two SIM slots, we recommend that OEMs include a numbered label for each slot. Some parts of the OS UI refer to the SIM slots by number, and including these labels will help provide a more consistent user experience.

The SIM slots are radio technology agnostic.

### 6.7.5 Video output

For a list of device types and operating systems where a video output port is required, optional, or not supported, see Table 3.

Devices that run Windows 10 must be compliant with the Microsoft WMDRM/PlayReady® Compliance Rules and Robustness Rules with respect to output protections.

Windows 10 supports the following video output ports on devices where a video output port is required or optional:

-   HDMI
-   DVI
-   DisplayPort
-   HD-15 (typical VGA connection)
-   S-Video
-   Component
-   Composite

### 6.8 UEFI and Secure Boot

Windows 10 for desktop editions and Windows 10 Mobile and IoT Core must boot into UEFI mode by default and ship with UEFI Secure Boot enabled. System firmware must be compliant with the UEFI Specification Version 2.3.1 or higher.

OEM systems for special purpose commercial systems, build to order, and customer systems with a custom image are not required to ship with UEFI Secure Boot enabled.

Windows 10 for desktop editions and IoT Core systems can optionally support the ability to disable Secure Boot via firmware setup. Windows 10 Mobile systems must not implement the ability to disable Secure Boot. Windows 10 for desktop editions and Windows 10 Mobile systems must implement measurements into PCR \[7\].

**Note**  No systems should allow programmatic disabling of Secure Boot during boot services or after exiting EFI boot services.

 

### 6.9 Accessibility

Most Windows 10 operating systems include the Narrator screen reader feature for accessibility. For Narrator to work correctly on a device that uses touch for the primary means of user input, the device must include a touch controller that can report at least four simultaneous contacts. OEMs should be aware of this when planning devices for markets with accessibility requirements. 

Where providing user input or output device connection points, provide at least one input and/or output connection that conforms to an industry standard non-proprietary format, directly or through the use of commercially available adapters. 

Numeric keys arranged in a rectangular keypad layout must have the number five key tactilely distinct from the other keys. If key repeat is supported, the delay before repeat must be adjustable to 2 seconds or more.  Keystroke should be adjustable of at least 0.5 seconds. And, the status of all locking or toggle controls must be discernible visually and either through touch or sound.   

All mechanically operated controls and keys shall comply with accessibility standards.  In other words, all controls and keys for the normal operation of a desktop or portable computer must be accessible. This includes the keyboard, keypad, power switch, reset button, unlocking controls for docking stations, and release buttons for expansion cards and drives. 

Hardware controls need to balance between the need to prevent accidental activation, especially for users with tremors or limited coordination, and the need to allow activation without using excessive force.  The force required to activate controls and keys shall be 5 lbs. (22.2 N) maximum. In other words, mechanically operated controls must be usable with one hand, without particular motions (twisting of the wrist, tight grasping, pinching) or considerable exertion (more than five pounds of force).

Provide a means to discern without vision each operable part of the experience such that users of all abilities are able to manipulate and control a device as expected. Example, visually impaired users should be able to operate the device.

Where hardware is intended for shared use and speech output is available, a tactile indication of the means to initiate the speech mode of operation shall be provided. 

Architecturally installed or free-standing non-portable products intended to be used in one location must have all controls necessary to access full functionality positioned for users with limited reach (such as for people who use wheelchairs). 

Do not use color as the only visual means of conveying information. Do not use color in a way that requires the user to discriminate between hues, indicate an action, prompt a response, or distinguish a visual element.
