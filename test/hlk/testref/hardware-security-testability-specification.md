# Hardware Security Testability Specification


## <span id="Introduction"></span><span id="introduction"></span><span id="INTRODUCTION"></span>Introduction

HSTI protects against misconfiguration of security features on Windows devices. For customers, HSTI provides best effort assurance that the machine they have purchased is secure by default. For IHVs and IBVs, HSTI makes sure your security promises are kept. For OEMs and ODMs easily ensure that the systems you ship are configured securely out of the box and will stay secure, without having to develop proprietary solutions.

The results of HSTI tests will be consumed by Windows Compatibility Tests and can be used to verify that devices have been properly configured to enable supported security features. These tests may be used to identify unsecured engineering devices in the field, for example, engineering devices which may contain insecure test keys. The results of these tests may be used by the Windows OS to display a watermark (or similar indicator) on insecure devices.

>[!NOTE]
>  The platform is required to implement a hardware interface and share documentation and tools as specified in this topic.

### <span id="Background"></span><span id="background"></span><span id="BACKGROUND"></span>Background

The reader is expected to know the fundamentals of UEFI and have an understanding of Secure Boot technologies including Section 27 "Security" of the UEFI specification and NIST SP 800-147.

This requirement has three aspects:

-   Platform independent interfaces for querying hardware and firmware security states
-   Design and optional code review of the above interface implementations
-   Sharing of documentation and tools

### <span id="High_Level_Implementation"></span><span id="high_level_implementation"></span><span id="HIGH_LEVEL_IMPLEMENTATION"></span>High Level Implementation

### <span id="The_Bitfield"></span><span id="the_bitfield"></span><span id="THE_BITFIELD"></span>The Bitfield

The IHV defines a bitfield representing the testable security features of the platform. This bitfield fully covers all defineable bits available for the HSTI objects returned by any IHV, IBV or OEM HSTI tests. The IHV implementor has to design the definition of the bitfield and provide appropriate documentation in order for IBVs to correctly return the results of their HSTI tests.

### <span id="SecurityFeaturesRequired"></span><span id="securityfeaturesrequired"></span><span id="SECURITYFEATURESREQUIRED"></span>SecurityFeaturesRequired

The SecurityFeaturesRequired field is only used in processing when a field in an IHV HSTI object and is the method by which the IHV defines the bitfield of required security features.

### <span id="SecurityFeaturesImplemented"></span><span id="securityfeaturesimplemented"></span><span id="SECURITYFEATURESIMPLEMENTED"></span>SecurityFeaturesImplemented

This is a bitfield of the security features implemented by the tests returning the HSTI object.

### <span id="SecurityFeaturesVerified"></span><span id="securityfeaturesverified"></span><span id="SECURITYFEATURESVERIFIED"></span>SecurityFeaturesVerified

This is a bitfield of the security features which have been verified by the tests returning the HSTI object.

### <span id="Implementation_Guidelines"></span><span id="implementation_guidelines"></span><span id="IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES"></span>Implementation Guidelines

The IHV will develop reference security designs for their platforms that comply with the Windows Compatibility Requirements. In addition, IHVs and IBVs will also implement programmatic tests that verify proper enablement of the reference security implementations and report the results via the Hardware Security Test Interface. These tests are delivered to OEMs & ODMs as compiled modules (not source) and should work without modification. If an OEM/ODM deviates from reference security designs, these test modules may report failures, and the OEM/ODM will need to contact Microsoft to review the modifications and implement an additional HSTI instance that reports these exceptions. OEMs should be able to leverage these security modules with no modification required by following the reference design and documentation. OEMs who wish to add additional security modules, or modify the behavior of any security module, must undergo a design review with Microsoft.

As part of their implementation of tests module implementors will include a struct. A prototype of this struct is included below in the "Prototype section". The IHV will define the meaning of each bit in the security reference checklist. The IHV will further define the meaning of each bit in the bitfields. Finally, the IHV includes a "Required" bitfield in the OEM struct, and for all requirements they are able to test programmatically they will set a bit in the "Implemented" bitfield.

IBVs and OEMs may set bits in the "Implemented" field if they have presented a design to progamatically check for the presence of the security features represented by those bits to Microsoft. If those tests pass they may set the "Verified" field in their respective structs.

The test modules for IHV, IBV and OEM shall be run if present. A true value set at a bit in the SecurityFeaturesEnabled field indicates a passing test result. If a test is not run, or does not pass, a value of 0 shall be set for the representative bit.

### <span id="Result_Processing_Logic_Example"></span><span id="result_processing_logic_example"></span><span id="RESULT_PROCESSING_LOGIC_EXAMPLE"></span>Result Processing Logic Example

This example is representative of the logic that will be used by the results processing. Implemented bitfields must follow the format that a 1 means implemented and a 0 means not implemented. If something is implemented it is required. Results bitfields must follow the format that a 0 means failed or test not present and a 1 means affirmatively passed only.

After all results have been calculated, the IHV Results bitfield will be NXORd with their Required bitfield. All non-IHV Results bitfields are ANDed with their respective Implemented bitfields. The resulting bitfields are all ORd together to get the overall results. A passing result of this operation will be a bitfield consisting of entirely 1s.

### <span id="Independent_Hardware_Vendors__IHVs__and_Independent_BIOS_Vendors__IBVs_"></span><span id="independent_hardware_vendors__ihvs__and_independent_bios_vendors__ibvs_"></span><span id="INDEPENDENT_HARDWARE_VENDORS__IHVS__AND_INDEPENDENT_BIOS_VENDORS__IBVS_"></span>Independent Hardware Vendors (IHVs) and Independent BIOS Vendors (IBVs)

Silicon Suppliers and IBVs who support Connected Standby systems must implement the platform independent interfaces for querying the respective hardware and firmware security states of their reference platforms. These implementations must be delivered as compiled modules. It is preferred that these modules be signed, and a signature check is performed when they are run. The purpose is to query the hardware and firmware designs & states to report proper security provisioning of the platform.

### <span id="OEMs_and_ODMs"></span><span id="oems_and_odms"></span><span id="OEMS_AND_ODMS"></span>OEMs and ODMs

OEMs and ODMs must not modify or tamper with the HSTI tests which have been provided to them by vendors. OEMs and ODMs are required to guarantee that their systems will pass the HSTI tests as a component of the Windows Certification requirements:

Windows Hardware Certification Requirement - [Windows 8.1 WHCR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj128256.aspx)

-   System.Fundamentals.Firmware.UEFISecureBoot
-   System.Fundamentals.Firmware.CS.UEFISecureBoot.ConnectedStandby

Instead of modification, if an OEM requires a method to provide an alternate method to provide the same or better security, that OEM may provide additional security checks. OEM security checks must at least fully cover one IHV or IBV security test. Before use, OEMs must submit to a design review by Microsoft and are subject to the same Documentation and Tool disclosure requirements as other HSTI test providers. Upon approval from Microsoft, the OEM may include security tests which extend upon the IHV and IBV tests.

Note that OEM attestation is not required as part of the HSTI design. HSTI is not a list of requirements for OEMs, it is an interface to guarantee effective programmatic security testing of firmware, hardware and configuration parameters.

## <span id="Security_State_Interfaces"></span><span id="security_state_interfaces"></span><span id="SECURITY_STATE_INTERFACES"></span>Security State Interfaces


The interfaces are built on the EFI Adapter Information Protocol defined in UEFI version 2.4.

## <span id="Optional_Code_Reviews"></span><span id="optional_code_reviews"></span><span id="OPTIONAL_CODE_REVIEWS"></span>Optional Code Reviews


HSTI implementers may request code reviews performed by Microsoft. Code reviews may be provided based on the priority and availability of resources and are not guaranteed. Code reviews will take place subject to a Non Disclosure Agreement.

## <span id="Documentation_and_Tools_sharing"></span><span id="documentation_and_tools_sharing"></span><span id="DOCUMENTATION_AND_TOOLS_SHARING"></span>Documentation and Tools sharing


Silicon and firmware suppliers should make available to Microsoft all necessary security-related reference documentation and tools that they provide to OEMs. This documentation and tools should be made available no later than they are provided to Windows OEMs. This should include, but is not limited to, all documentation and tools related to fusing, installing and updating firmware, firmware and boot recovery, hardware diagnostics, firmware diagnostics, & boot diagnostics. This documentation and tools provided should be fully sufficient to perform HSTI checks in a lab environment.

## <span id="HSTI_Design_Considerations"></span><span id="hsti_design_considerations"></span><span id="HSTI_DESIGN_CONSIDERATIONS"></span>HSTI Design Considerations


The following is an illustrative list of design considerations that an HSTI implementor must consider for their HSTI implementation. This is not a strict list of requirements, nor is it an exhaustive list of considerations. As an HSTI implementor you will be writing tests to validate the security features you have working towards as comprehensive coverage as possible. Before your design review with Microsoft we recommend you review this list for inspiration, and consider that Microsoft is likely to desire that if you implement these features you test them as extensively as possible.
