-   If you provide a custom INF with your device, you must run the HLK tests using the Windows class driver (you may not test using your custom INF).

-   Your device must install with the Microsoft Media Transfer Protocol class driver.

-   For Windows Vista and later, your device must appear under the **Portable Devices** category in **Device Manager**.

-   Devices that are read-only must include at least one sample of each format type supported by the device.

-   If the device supports removable media, the media must be added before testing.

-   Run the test with only one portable device connected at a time (this includes Mass Storage Class devices).

-   The battery on the device should be fully charged before testing is started.

To run portable device tests, you must know how to:

-   Switch a device to a computer connectivity mode before plugging it in.

-   Plug a device into a USB port of the computer and maintain the connectivity throughout the test.

-   Provide continuous power to the device throughout the test.

-   Troubleshoot device installation by checking if the device is installed successfully in **Device Manager** or by looking at the SetupAPI device installation logs.
