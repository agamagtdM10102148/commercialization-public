# MBN WHLK Content for a GSM Device


The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive view of the MBN WHLK requirements, operations and expectations, by showing the summary log results of a successful test run.

## <span id="How_to_read_MBN_Logs"></span><span id="how_to_read_mbn_logs"></span><span id="HOW_TO_READ_MBN_LOGS"></span>How to read MBN Logs


The MBN operations are listed in chronological order. The beginning of an operation will be shown in black and the successful completion of an operation will be shown with a leading "PASS:". If an operation has sub operations, the entries will be indented and be between the beginning and end operation. If the operation fails in test, it will be shown with a leading "FAIL:".

The MBN Tests utilize Windows Software trace preprocessor (WPP). A trace can be obtained by using the following commands:

1.  tracelog.exe -b 64 -cir 10 -start MBNWHLK -ft 0 -guid \#{d58c1268-b309-11d1-969e-0000f875a532} -flag 0x7fffffff -level 5 -f MBNWHLK.bin

2.  Execute Test

3.  tracelog.exe -stop MBNWHLK

4.  MBNWHLK.bin will then be available in the current directory

MBN Tests are built on Windows Test Authoring and Execution Framework (TAEF). The tests can be easily executed from the command line.

### <span id="Test_Parameters"></span><span id="test_parameters"></span><span id="TEST_PARAMETERS"></span>Test Parameters

-   INTF - Specifies which device to target testing. The value can be either interface MAC or GUID. This parameter is optional, if not specified the tests will use any WWAN Interface on the machine.

-   PIN1 - Specifies the PIN1 associated with the device. This value is only required for the PIN tests and only if the device supports PIN1. If not specified the test will execute and fail if appropriate.

-   PUK1 - Specifies the PUK1 associated with the device. This value is only required for the PIN tests and only if the device supports PUK1. If not specified the test will execute and fail if appropriate. Be very careful about providing the PUK1 on a real device. If an incorrect PUK1 is provided or the device does not support PUK1 the device could be irreversibly locked.

-   WEBDOC8K - Specifies a web doc over 8K in size. This parameter is optional, if provided the test will use this URL rather than the default URL. The default URL is [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=867396](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=867396)

-   WEBDOC1024K - Specifies a web doc over 1024K in size. This parameter is optional, if provided the test will use this URL rather than the default URL. The default URL is [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=867397](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=867397)

-   DevPhoneNumber - Specifies the phone number of the device. This parameter is optional and used only by the SMS Tests. If the parameter is not specified the test will attempt to retrieve the phone number from the device.
