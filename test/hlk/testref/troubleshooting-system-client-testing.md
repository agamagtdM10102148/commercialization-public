# Troubleshooting System Client Testing


To troubleshoot issues that occur with System.Client tests, follow these steps:

1. Review the following Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) topics:

   - [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md)

   - [System Client Testing Prerequisites](system-client-testing-prerequisites.md)

2. Review the [Windows HLK release notes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=236110) for current test issues.

3. Verify that you have installed the latest Windows HLK filters and kit updates. For more information, see [Windows Hardware Lab Kit Filters](../user/windows-hardware-lab-kit-filters.md).

4. For a test failure, look for usable information in the Windows HLK Studio test log. If you find usable information, resolve the issue and rerun the test.

5. If you cannot obtain a successful test result, contact [Windows HLK Support](../user/windows-hlk-support.md).
