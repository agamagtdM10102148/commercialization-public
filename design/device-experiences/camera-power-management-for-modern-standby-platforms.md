# Camera power management for modern standby platforms


The cameras in modern mobile platforms allow users to capture still and motion video of their surroundings, and to use video and audio to communicate with other users over the Internet. The general goal of power management for a camera device can be described simply—the camera subsystem must be powered off, consuming zero watts, unless the camera is in active use.

When the camera is actively being used to stream video to an application, the camera sensor and related components should be powered on. Windows enables the camera hardware to be turned off during modern standby by suspending any foreground Microsoft Store apps that might be streaming data from the camera device. Windows makes no provisions for the use of camera devices while the system is in modern standby, so a camera device can be used only when the display is turned on.

<td><p>Both the on-SoC image processing units and the off-SoC camera components are expected to consume no power (zero watts) when the system is in connected standby and the display is turned off. The primary software mechanism for power management is reference counting of the camera capture pin.</p></td>

<td><p>Windows supports a single hardware power management configuration for camera devices in modern standby platforms. In short, each camera sensor must be connected to the SoC via a MIPI-CSI link, and can optionally be connected to an I2C bus and to one or more GPIO pins. The camera sensor device, its optional flash, and any other off-SoC camera components must be placed on a power rail that can be switched on and off by ACPI firmware.</p></td>
