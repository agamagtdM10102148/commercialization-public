# <span id="p_hlk_test.478fe5ef-5f3d-49cd-a971-b6bdbe03e12c"></span>File Storage SMAPI Test


This automated test verifies file storage management on a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. It does this by testing Storage Management API (SMAPI) connectivity from the NAS device to the HLK client computer through an SMI-S storage provider.

## <span id="Running_the_test"></span><span id="running_the_test"></span><span id="RUNNING_THE_TEST"></span>Running the test


Before running the test, you'll need the following:

-   Hardware
    -   A Network Attached Storage (NAS) array and its provider.
    -   Ethernet connectivity between the NAS array/provider and the host (HLK client computer).
-   Software
    -   The Windows Standards-Based Storage Management feature. If this package is not installed, the test will automatically install it. The HLK client computer requires internet connectivity for the package to be installed.

For this test, you must configure a NAS array that has network connectivity to the HLK client computer.

These NAS arrays are not directly connected to a host. They connect to the host through a storage provider. A storage provider can provide connectivity to one of more storage arrays.

The test requires a set of parameters to be passed before running the test. These parameters are specific to the NAS array and how it is connected to the host.

For generic troubleshooting of HLK test failures, see [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md).

A value of 0 indicates that the test was successful. A value of 1 indicates that the test failed. The HLK controller will capture this return code, and will show whether the HLK job passed or failed.

Review the test log files saved at TestDestFolder referenced in the parameter list on the HLK client computer, and fix the setup issue that is causing the test to fail.
