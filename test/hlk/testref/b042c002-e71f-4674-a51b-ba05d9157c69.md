Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [WDTF System Fundamentals Testing Prerequisites](wdtf-system-fundamentals-testing-prerequisites.md). In addition, insert a bootable USB storage device, at least 500MB in size or larger. If the test system has PC\\AT firmware, configure it to boot from USB first.

The test will do the following steps:

1.  Provision the USB Drive with Windows PE.

2.  Restart the host operating system and attempt to boot from the USB drive.

3.  Restart the system from the USB drive three times.

4.  Boot back into to host operating system and format the USB drive.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> You must insert the USB drive into a 3.0 port if there is one on the machine, otherwise the test will fail. Additionally, you must provide the supplemental content (a Windows PE image capable of booting on the ARM system).

For generic troubleshooting of HLK test failures, see [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md).

For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting System Fundamentals Testing](troubleshooting-system-fundamentals-testing.md).

This test will always return Pass or Fail. To review test details, review the test log from Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) Studio. The test will only fail if the system doesn't support creating firmware boot entries, boot from USB, or if the USB drive is not enumerated during warm reboot.
