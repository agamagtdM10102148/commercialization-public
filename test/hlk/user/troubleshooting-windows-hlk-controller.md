# Troubleshooting Windows HLK Controller


This topic describes how to troubleshoot issues with the Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK) Controller.

For help with problems that occur during Windows HLK Controller setup, see [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Setup](troubleshooting-windows-hlk-setup.md).

## <span id="adddtest"></span><span id="ADDDTEST"></span>Cannot add test clients after installing the WindowsÂ HLK


After installing Windows HLK, the Windows HLK Controller cannot access the HLKJobs database. This prevents the Windows HLK Controller from responding to new clients or sending updates to existing clients.

To fix this problem, stop and restart the **MSSQLServer** service on the Windows HLK Controller by using Services Management Console (From a command prompt, type services.msc). The **MSSQLServer** service should be set to **Automatic**.

## Transaction log is too large (standalone SQL Server 2012)

When using the HLK with standalone SQL Server 2012, if you find that your transaction log is growing too large or too fast, [you may need to adjust your recovery configuration.](microsoft-sql-server-options.md#using-the-hlk-with-standalone-sql-server-2012)
