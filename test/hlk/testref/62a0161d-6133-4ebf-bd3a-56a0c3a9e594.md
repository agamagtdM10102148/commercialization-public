This test verifies the functionality of the smart card reader by validating the revision two of the PC/SC workgroup test cards.

The test and its hardware must be able to execute specific IFD tests and produce a test report. Specific requirements deal with nominal operation and exceptional operation (error conditions). In addition, these must be applied to all protocols supported by the reader subsystem.

A configuration file needs to be provided for the following types of smart card readers:

-   Contactless
-   Virtual
-   Requires network

The configuration file must be named ifdtest\_config.xml and must be placed in C:\\SmartCardReaderTest. The following snippet shows a sample configuration file:

``` syntax
<SmartCardReader>
   <Version>1</Version>
   <Contactless>False</Contactless>
   <Virtual>False</Virtual>
   <Network>False</Network>
</SmartCardReader>
```

IFDTEST2 performs test cases in three separate test jobs: Reader Interface tests are performed without anything inserted in the reader. Resource Manager Status test cases are performed as a sample card is inserted into and removed from the reader, and do handling of card insertion detection under various conditions (any card can be used for this test).

Card Protocol tests involve operation both with inserted representative ordinarily available smart cards and with special cards that exhibit certain specially programmed behavior. The test cases using ordinarily available cards will perform routine operations on cards selected to represent a variety of communication speed and protocol combinations. These tests have changed with the card-set 2.

**Resource manager status test cases**

Part A

The card monitor test cases check for correct detection of smart card insertion state and correct handling of operations interrupted by the unexpected removal of the card.

1.  Test detection of empty readers using IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_IS\_PRESENT

2.  Test detection of inserted card using IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_IS\_PRESENT

3.  Test removal of inserted card using IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_IS\_ABSENT

4.  Test correct handling of randomly timed card insert and remove actions for 15 seconds

    -   Verify that IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_IS\_PRESENT and IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_IS\_ABSENT produce valid results

Part C

The resource manager test cases verify successful completion of state change operations normally expected to be commanded by the smart card resource manager.

1.  Verify IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_GET\_STATE succeeds without card

2.  Verify returned state is valid

3.  Verify correct return from IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_IS\_PRESENT

4.  Verify correct return from IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_IS\_ABSENT

5.  Operator inserts a card

6.  Verify IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_GET\_STATE succeeds with card inserted

7.  Verify returned state is valid

8.  Verify correct return from IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_IS\_ABSENT

9.  Cold reset the card

10. Verify card state is SCARD\_NEGOTIABLE

11. Set Card Protocol to T0 or T1

12. Verify success of IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_POWER to turn off the card

13. Operator removes the card

14. Verify IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_GET\_STATE succeeds without a card

Part E

The power management test cases verify that the driver returns the correct state information for the reader across hibernation sequences, even when the state of the reader is changed during hibernation by insertion or removal of a card.

1.  Operator removes all cards

2.  Operator hibernates computer

3.  Operator starts computer

4.  Verify reader state SCARD\_ABSENT on return from hibernate

5.  Operator Inserts card

6.  Operator hibernates computer

7.  Operator starts computer

8.  Verify reader state SCARD\_PRESENT on return from hibernate

9.  Operator removes card

10. Operator hibernates computer

11. Operator removes card during hibernate

12. Operator starts computer

13. Verify reader state SCARD\_ABSENT on return from hibernate

14. Operator hibernates computer

15. Operator inserts card during hibernate

16. Operator starts computer

17. Verify reader state SCARD\_PRESENT on return from hibernate

**Reader interface test cases**

Part B

Reader interface test cases check for the correct implementation property and state information at the reader driver.

1.  Check attributes reported by the reader with a sample card inserted

2.  Test that device name reported by the driver is WDM PnP compliant

3.  Test that driver correctly handles attribute read requests with NULL return buffer

4.  Test that driver correctly stops pending i/o requests if the driver is closed and reopened with an i/o operation pending

5.  Test read attributes with no card inserted

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_VENDOR\_NAME : non-zero-length string

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_VENDOR\_IFD\_TYPE : non-zero-length string

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_DEVICE\_UNIT : a 4 byte or larger length value

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_ATR\_STRING : read attempt fails

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_DEFAULT\_CLK : 1000 &lt;= value &lt;= 20000

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_MAX\_CLK : 1000 &lt;= value &lt;= 20000

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_DEFAULT\_DATA\_RATE : read attempt succeeds

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_MAX\_DATA\_RATE : read attempt succeeds

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_MAX\_IFSD : 1 &lt;= value &lt;= 254

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_CURRENT\_PROTOCOL\_TYPE : read attempt fails

6.  Test read attributes with a card inserted

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_VENDOR\_NAME : non-zero-length string

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_VENDOR\_IFD\_TYPE : non-zero-length string

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_DEVICE\_UNIT : a 4 byte or larger length value

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_ATR\_STRING : read attempt succeeds

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_DEFAULT\_CLK : value 1000 &lt;= value &lt;= 20000

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_MAX\_CLK : value 1000 &lt;= value &lt;= 20000

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_DEFAULT\_DATA\_RATE : read attempt succeeds

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_MAX\_DATA\_RATE : read attempt succeeds

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_MAX\_IFSD : 1 &lt;= value &lt;= 254

    -   SCARD\_ATTR\_CURRENT\_PROTOCOL\_TYPE : value = 0

7.  Read card state with card removed using IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_GET\_STATE : state &lt;= SCARD\_SWALLOWED

8.  Reset card : verify result is ERROR\_UNRECOGNIZED\_MEDIA
