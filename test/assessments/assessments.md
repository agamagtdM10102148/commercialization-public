# Assessments


Assessments are a combination of .xml and binary files that induce a specific set of states on a computer, measure and record the activity, and preserve the recorded results. The results provide metrics and sometimes recommendations for resolving issues that the assessments found. Assessments help you assess hardware or software that has been added to a computer.

Assessments and the Windows Assessment Console are available as part of the Windows Assessment Toolkit that's available in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK). After you install the Windows Assessment Toolkit, you can use the Windows Assessment Console to create and run a job that includes one or more assessments. You can also package jobs to run them on computers that don't have the Windows Assessment Toolkit installed.

Assessments are also available when you install Windows Assessment Services and the Windows Assessment Services - Client (Windows ASC).

This diagram shows the general workflow for an assessment:
