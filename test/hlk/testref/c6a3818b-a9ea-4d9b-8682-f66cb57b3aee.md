# <span id="p_hlk_test.c6a3818b-a9ea-4d9b-8682-f66cb57b3aee"></span>DXVA High Definition Video Processing - VideoProcessing


This manual test runs test cases across the following: IDXVAHD\_VideoProcessor::SetVideoProcessBltState, IDXVAHD\_VideoProcessor::GetVideoProcessBltState, IDXVAHD\_VideoProcessor::SetVideoProcessStreamState, IDXVAHD\_VideoProcessor::GetVideoProcessStreamState, and IDXVAHD\_VideoProcessor::VideoProcessBltHD.

For details about all of the test cases, see the "Supporting information" section below. Most test cases present to the screen while a utility post-processes the frames for comparison. Most test cases enforce a &gt; 20.0f PSNR between software and hardware processed frames. For some test cases, the threshold is lowered due to lack of support of some filters and features in the software implementation.

The test will for the most part just show a ticker-like window incrementing pass fail counts and showing which test case variables are being iterated upon.

Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Graphic Adapter or Chipset Testing Prerequisites](graphic-adapter-or-chipset-testing-prerequisites.md).

In addition, this test requires the following software:

-   A display driver that supports D3D9Caps.Caps3 D3DCAPS3\_DXVAHD. Specifically:

    -   D3D9 support exposing D3DCAPS3\_DXVAHD.

    -   Required output formats: D3DFMT\_X8R8G8B8, D3DFMT\_A8R8G8B8.

    -   Required input formats: D3DFMT\_X8R8G8B8, D3DFMT\_A8R8G8B8, D3DFMT\_YUY2, D3DFMT\_AYUV and any decode render targets supported.

-   dxvahdsw.dll.

For generic troubleshooting of HLK test failures, see [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](../user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures.md).

For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting Device.Graphics Testing](troubleshooting-devicegraphics-testing.md).

This test will for the most part just show a ticker-like window incrementing pass fail counts and showing which test case variables are being iterated upon.

The test will return Pass or Fail. The test might return SKIP if the driver does not expose D3DCAPS3\_DXVAHD. Other test cases can skip based on stream state support, inverse telecine caps, filter caps, feature caps, and formats supported. To review test details, review the test log from the DTM Studio.

After each SetVideoProcessBltState, call the corresponding GetVideoProcessBltState. The call ensures proper reporting, then processes and presents frames compared to the reference frames for accuracy. Most BltStates are cycled across for each full cycle of a given BltState, then again for each valid StreamState. However, some permutations are not necessary.

-   Verify invalid data types passed to SetVideoProcessBltState and GetVideoProcessBltState return E\_INVALIDARG.

-   DXVAHD\_BLT\_STATE\_TARGET\_RECT\_DATA

    -   Verify Limiting Data to rect smaller than output surface results in correct scaling.

    -   Verify a rect larger than the output surface results in an expanded frame.

    -   Verify when target rect data is set and Enable flagged as false, that the entire surface is used.

    -   Process one frame with target rect data and Enable set to false. Then process another frame with target rect data shrunken, expanded, or moved, and Enable is true. Verify the surface scales or moves accordingly.

    -   Verify Default no data set results in entire surface being used.

-   DXVAHD\_BLT\_STATE\_BACKGROUND\_COLOR\_DATA

    -   Verify Default is RGB Black.

    -   If YCbCr is set to true, verify correct color range for background is actually presented.

    -   Verify RGB Orange (255,165, 0) along with default black value with alpha values for both RGB and YcbCr

    -   with DXVAHD\_BLT\_STATE\_OUTPUT\_COLOR\_SPACE\_DATA

        -   Verify that if Background Color of YCbCr is used and ColorSpaceData is of Full RGB\_Range, that Full range RGB is ignored and the correct limited range is used per the specified Matrix and xvYCC setting.

    -   with DXVAHD\_BLT\_STATE\_ALPHA\_FILL

        -   Verify the alpha value of given background color when DXVAHD\_ALPHA\_FILL\_MODE\_BACKGROUND is used across different background colors.

    -   Verify Default Usage, RGB\_Range, YCbCr\_Matrix, and YCbCr\_xvYCC are all set to 0.

    -   Verify Limiting RGB\_Range successfully limits color range to 16..235.

    -   Verify BT.709 correctly increases luma and chroma accordingly.

    -   xvYCC successfully extends color range. This validation is a special case, because the reference video processor does not support any output surface other than XRGB. Validation of this is difficult, and the process will be documented at a later time.

    -   Verify if DXVAHD\_VPDEVCAPS.DeviceCaps does not have DXVAHD\_DEVICE\_CAPS\_xvYCC. Validate YCbCr\_xvYCC does not adjust any settings, and is truly ignored.

    -   Tolerance is flexible initially, but the starting percentage of pixel precision is 90 percent accuracy.

-   DXVAHD\_BLT\_STATE\_ALPHA\_FILL\_DATA

    -   Verify that output surfaces not of Alpha format are unchanged.

    -   Verify that output surfaces of Alpha format successfully apply alpha values to the color.

    -   Verify default Mode adjusts Background Alpha values correctly.

        Test Input Surface of NonAlpha Format with an output surface of Alpha Format. Validate alpha correctness with again flexible precision, initially at 90 percent accuracy.

-   DXVAHD\_BLT\_STATE\_CONSTRICTION\_DATA

    -   Due to lack of support in the Reference driver for the course of M2 constriction, test cases must be validated outside of direct 1:1 comparison for valid down-sampled sizes.

    -   Verify correct down-sampling to the output surface.

    -   If the size is greater than the target, verify that constriction is limited to the size of the target rect.

    -   Attempt to set sizes to 0,\* and \*, 0 validate return value E\_INVALIDARG.

    -   If DXVAHD\_VPDEVCAPS.FeatureCaps does not expose DXVAHD\_FEATURE\_CAPS\_CONSTRICTION, then verify that error E\_INVALIDARG is returned when Constriction is attempted to be set.

    -   Verify that Default Value represents disabled. If disabled is flagged and a size is specified, the size value is ignored.

-   DXVAHD\_BLT\_STATE\_PRIVATE\_DATA

    -   Pass invalid Guid, DataSize, and pData. Validate that driver handles accordingly.

    -   Null pData retrieves correct size of the private blt state.

<!-- -->

    -   If DXVAHD\_VPDEVCAPS.InputFormatCaps does not report support for DXVAHD\_INPUT\_FORMAT\_CAPS\_RGB\_LIMITED\_RANGE, verify that when RGB\_Range is 1, it is ignored and FullRange is used.

        -   Limited range validation is not possible with a 1:1 comparison with the reference. Some loose validation of whites and blacks may be possible to validate the color range has been limited accordingly.

    -   Verify BT.709 correctly increases luma and chroma sampling.

    -   xvYCC successfully extends color range.

    -   Verify that if DXVAHD\_VPDEVCAPS.DeviceCaps does not report support for xvYCC.

    -   If possible, and if processing is specified, validate increased color conversion performance.

    -   Verify if DXVAHD\_VPDEVCAPS.DeviceCaps does not have DXVAHD\_DEVICE\_CAPS\_xvYCC. Validate YCbCr\_xvYCC does not adjust any settings, and is truly ignored.

            -   ITELECINE support will not be available in the reference video processor, so direct comparison is impossible. For validation, a telecine frame is generated and passed to the reference. Then the non-telecine frame is processed and compared to that of the frames provided by the telecine frame.

    -   Test unsupported CustomRate, both interpolated and repeated.

    -   Test unsupported CustomRate at both NormalRate and HalfRate. Verify that error E\_INVALIDARG is returned.

    -   Validate that supported CustomRates are not successfully set unless DXVAHD\_OUTPUT\_RATE\_CUSTOM is specified.

    -   Verify Limiting Data to rect smaller than input surface results in correct scaling.

    -   Verify a rect larger than the input surface results in the clipped areas being transparent.

    -   Verify when source rect data is set and Enable flagged as false, the entire surface is used.

    -   Once one frame is processed with source rect data and Enable is false, then a second frame is processed with source rect data and Enable is true, verify that the surface is visible and scales according to the rect size to the input surface.

    -   Verify Default no data set results in entire surface being used.

    -   Verify Default no data set results in entire surface being used.

-   DXVAHD\_STREAM\_STATE\_ALPHA\_DATA

    -   All Alpha test cases require more than one video stream, therefore multiplying these test cases by two.

    -   Verify default values alpha is disabled.

    -   Verify Low, Mid, and High range alpha blending, and verify transparency.

    -   Verify out of range float alpha value fails during processing.
